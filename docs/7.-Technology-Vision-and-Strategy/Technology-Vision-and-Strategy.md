# Who is this for?
This section describes the way in which we plan ahead to ensure our technology estate will continue to serve the business and product needs in the future.

All members of Platform Development will have an interest in ensuring that this approach is fit for purpose, and engineers need to engage with the vision and strategy by offering their expertise and insights to help us define and refine the path ahead

# Vision
<div style="color:#D22C46; text-align:center; font-size:1.5em; border:1px solid silver">Continually improve our effectiveness, <br>by improving our ability to deliver value fast and sustainably, <br>whilst meeting quality, security, stability and performance needs <br> to increase the longevity of our technology while increasing the rate at which we deliver value </div>


# Guiding Principals
- All engineers must engage and contribute towards our technology strategy, roadmap and backlog
- The Tech Leadership team will are here to help drive the strategy forwards, not dictate it
- Ideas are validated rapidly before being included in the strategy or added to the roadmap
- Engineers must work collaboratively to ensure roadmap items are prepared for sprints in a timely manner
- Finding the best approach and solution for the problem is more important than delivering it quickly: a problem solved quickly is not the same as a problem solved well.
