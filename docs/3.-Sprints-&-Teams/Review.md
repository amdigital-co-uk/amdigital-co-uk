# Overview
A review of work carried out by Platform Development in the latest 2-week sprint, including demos of bug fixes and new functionality ahead of release.

The review gives all interested parties an opportunity to inspect what has been built to date and time to ask questions, make observations or suggestions, and have discussions about how to best move forward.

The review helps ensure we're building successful product and gives us the opportunity to get feedback from the business stakeholders who are typically not available on a daily basis.

1. All teams must present at every review to describe what has been accomplished and answer any questions
2. Every team member should have the opportunity to present rather than the same person every time
