# Overview
The team will review the candidates, their capacity for the sprint, then determine what work is required to complete the each of the candidates. They will estimate in hours each of the discrete work items that need to be performed.

They will work in priority order, and stop planning when capacity is nearly matched by planned work.

If the next priority item is deemed too large, the team may seek a smaller, lower priority candidate that can fit into the sprint.

# Agenda
1. Review capacity - planned absences, known availability etc.
1. Review candidates at a high level
1. Speculate Sprint Goal
1. Start planning each item, determine approximate order of tasks
1. When capacity is filled and Sprint Backlog is finalised, discuss and align on plan for executing work
1. Finalise Sprint Goal
1. Communicate goal and backlog to Enablement team

# Tips for Success
1. Be realistic about hours estimates. Optimism is likely to cause failure. Review past tasks to determine and improve estimation accuracy.
1. Everyone in the team needs to leave with a clear understanding of the plan. DO NOT ASSUME that because someone has explained something that everyone has understood it.
1. Speak out if you don't understand, you are equally responsible for ensuring that you leave the meeting with a good understanding of what needs to be done.
1. If understanding of a problem is limited, plan right from the start to work in a way that improves team understanding, such as pair programming.
