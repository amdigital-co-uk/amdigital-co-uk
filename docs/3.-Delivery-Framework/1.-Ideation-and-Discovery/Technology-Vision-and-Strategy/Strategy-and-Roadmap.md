## Overview

- Describe the general purpose of the Tech Roadmap
- Ideas are validated and added to roadmap -> Roadmap items are broken down into backlog items (describe item types, add examples)
- Describe who owns and contributes to it and who it is for

## Discovery

### Technology Vision and Strategy

- Describe the purpose of the Vision and strategy and link to it

### Capturing Ideas and Creating Roadmap Items

- At any point any member of the platform development team can (and should!) add new ideas to the technology ideation repository.
- Each of these ideas needs to go through some degree of validation
- This will depend upon the estimated complexity and scale of the idea
- Validation is performed using the "Technology Canvas"
- Each item will have a lead assigned

Validation means ensuring it is valuable, feasible, and aligned with our vision and strategy

1. Create an Idea item and complete as much of the canvas as possible
1. Ideas are reviewed by the engineering team periodically (practice TBC), during which early prioritisation is performed and a lead is assigned
1. The lead will then continue the validation process and complete the canvas
1. If it is determined not be be valuable, viable, feasible, the reasons for this are captured, and no further work is done
1. Otherwise it will be shared with the Technology Governance Group (TGG), who will evaluate and feedback, offering guidance for further validation. The TGG may also veto.
1. Once the TGG are aligned with the canvas the Lead will estimate, rank, prioritise, and set a delivery target, utilising other members of the team to do this. Then add to the roadmap. (TLDR; any validated  idea that has a delivery target, is essentially on the roadmap)
1. The TGG will review the roadmap and feedback on, or adjust priority

### Guidelines for Technology Governance Group

- When evaluating canvases, feedback should help them further improve the validation they have performed, rather than directly offering a different opinion
- This will allow them to improve their ability to validate in the future
- None the less, the TGG may veto the idea regardless of the conclusions/suggestions made, if it is deemed tangential to the vision and mission
- The TGG need to ensure they set aside time to support the discovery process
- The TGG should organise regular sessions to review the roadmap priorities.

## Definition

- Similar to definition practice for Product BLIs
- The lead for the Technical Roadmap Item (TRI) will typically be the same person who was lead for the Idea, but this will not always be possible or appropriate
- The TRI lead should convene a "3 Amigos" group (or an "N Amigos" group) to provide input from Technical, Testing, Design, Security (etc) perspectives as appropriate to the TRI
- TRIs are broken down into one or more backlog items (BLIs), typically these will be "Technical Improvements"
- During the definition phase we explore and define overall solution we are aiming for, then turn this into a number of distinct deliverables
- At appropriate points within the definition process, the Software Architect should be consulted, who can provide guidance and feedback as to how the solution fits within the overall platform.
- As with product BLIs, the technical improvement BLIs should contain an overview of the desired technical solution and architectural design.
- If it is determined that we have insufficient knowledge to proceed, the N Amigos group can create an Investigation BLI to find any unknowns. The investigation should have a well defined outcome, to ensure the result means we can progress with definition thereafter.
- Each BLI should then be reviewed and estimated
- Each backlog item does not need to be delivered at the same time! We can add value gradually. This plan should be captured in the parent Roadmap Item.

`// TODO
Define actual mechanisms for assigning leads, reviewing backlog/ideas repo
Define "ready"
Summarise practice for getting work into sprints i.e. pre-planning
Describe the different "Technical Value Types"
