This is the place to start when you join Platform Development at AM. It is designed for new starters, regardless of their role.

It will point you to key areas of the playbook, to provide a quick overview of the department and how we work.

Much of this should be covered during your induction. The playbook is your companion from induction to mastery.

## Initial Reading

### Early Days

1. The Platform Development division have a unified [mission](#our-mission). Everything we do aims to aid us in achieving this mission. You need to know this.
1. We follow a way of working aligned with DevOps and Product lead culture. [Our ways of working](/2.-Ways-of-Working/) section outlines this.
1. We have a [framework](/3.-Delivery-Framework/) that describes how we derive and deliver value.
1. We maintain some [department-specific policies](/5.-Department-Policies/) and you should take some time to review these and know where to find them in the future.

## Going Deeper

1. Within our framework we have defined but evolving processes, guidelines, standards, and best practices. You may choose to learn about and refer back these as you come across them. [Delivery Practices](/4.-Delivery-Practices/)
1. We build and maintain [Quartex](https://www.quartexcollections.com/), internal tooling, and legacy platforms. You will need to get to know how these platforms work and the value they bring to our business.
1. This playbook is owned and maintained by the team. You should learn (how to use it)[/6.-Playbook-User-Guide/]. It will evolve and may become out of date. Everyone is expected to participate in it's upkeep.
