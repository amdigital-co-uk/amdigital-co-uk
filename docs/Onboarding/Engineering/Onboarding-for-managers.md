title: Onboarding for Managers 
---

## Joining as an E4+ / Manager

Starting a new leadership or managerial role can be challenging, as you learn about an organisation and your new job you also have to learn about your new team and the personalities within it, and take on leadership responsibilities. 

This guide supplements the [primary onboarding guide](index.md), and provides an outline of the additional onboarding outcomes at each of the 4 phases.

Note that in some instances line management transfer may occur later than outlined here, due to other constraints. This will be coordinated by your manager and the VP of Engineering.
