title: Engineering Buddy Guide

**So, you've been asked to buddy up with a new starter? Here's what you need to know...**

Becoming an Engineering Buddy is a unique opportunity to make a significant difference in the early days of a new colleague's journey. Whether they're a software engineer or test engineer, your role is instrumental in ensuring their transition is smooth, informative, and welcoming. This guide will walk you through the key responsibilities and best practices of an effective Engineering Buddy.

## Responsibilities

1. **Warm Welcome**: As a first point of contact, ensure they feel integrated into our engineering culture. A friendly face and open communication can set the tone for their entire onboarding experience.

2. **Clarify the Basics**: Ensure they have a solid foundational understanding of our:
    - Team structures
    - Working environment setup - such as local development and testing tools.
    - Codebase and repositories.
    - Tools, platforms, and tech stack.
    - Development and testing methodologies and tools.
    - Documentation repositories
    - Working practices and methodologies.

3. **Navigate the Code**: Take them through our main codebase, as appropriate for their role. Discuss our coding and testing standards, comment practices, and the code or test architecture of the major modules.

4. **Pair Programming/Testing**: Dedicate some time to pairing. This hands-on approach allows them to familiarize themselves with our code and understand our development flow.

5. **Regular Check-ins**: Have daily touchpoints for the first week: a quick call rather than a message, then switch to less frequent check-ins based on their comfort and confidence level.

6. **Feedback Loop**: Encourage them to share their insights, questions, and feedback. Address any gaps or uncertainties they might have. Proactively seek feedback by asking questions.

7. **Introduce to the Team**: Ensure they get to know key team members, especially those they'll be working closely with.

8. **Cultural Integration**: Share the unwritten rules, the fun rituals, and the quirks that make our engineering team unique.

9.  **Provide Resources**: Point them to essential documentation, wikis, and any other resources that will assist their learning process.

10. **Problem-Solving Support**: Be there to guide them through challenges, whether it's a code issue, a tool they're unfamiliar with, or a company process they're yet to grasp. If you're not sure that's ok, bring a SME in to help you.

## Best Practices

- **Empathy**: Remember your first days and the challenges you faced. Be the support that you wish you had had.
  
- **Active Listening**: Pay attention to their concerns, questions, and feedback. Sometimes, all they need is someone to listen. Ask the questions that encourage further sharing and openness.
  
- **Patience**: They might ask the same question more than once, or need more time to understand a concept. Be patient and provide explanations as needed. They are processing a great deal of information.
  
- **Encourage Independence**: While it's important to be there for them, also encourage them to find answers independently. It's a fine balance between providing support and fostering self-reliance.
  
- **Feedback**: Constructive feedback is essential. Guide them on how they can improve and celebrate their early wins.

## Getting Help

As an Engineering Buddy, you are not expected to onboard a new team member all by yourself. Most of that responsibility lies with their manager. You can find out more about how line managers support new starters [here](Line-Managers-Duties-For-New-Starters.md).

If you need help with your buddying, speak to your manager, or the manager of your buddy. Either will be able to offer support.

## Final Thoughts

Your role as an Engineering Buddy is pivotal in setting the stage for a new starter's success. By providing them with the tools, support, and environment they need to thrive, you're not only helping them but also contributing to the strength and unity of our engineering team.
