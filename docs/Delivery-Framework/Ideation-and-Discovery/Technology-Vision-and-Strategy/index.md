## Vision

!!! quote
    Continually improve our effectiveness,

    By improving our ability to deliver value fast and sustainably, 

    Whilst meeting quality, security, stability and performance needs

    To increase the longevity of our technology while increasing the rate at which we deliver value

## Guiding Principals

- All engineers must engage and contribute towards our technology strategy, roadmap and backlog
- The Tech Leadership team will are here to help drive the strategy forwards, not dictate it
- Ideas are validated rapidly before being included in the strategy or added to the roadmap
- Engineers must work collaboratively to ensure roadmap items are prepared for sprints in a timely manner
- Finding the best approach and solution for the problem is more important than delivering it quickly: a problem solved quickly is not the same as a problem solved well.

## Contextual Overview

- Our **Technology Vision** guides our Tech Strategy.
- Our **Technology Strategy** describes what we aim to achieve in mid-to-long term, in line with our guiding vision  
- The Technology Strategy informs our **Tech Roadmap**, a set of high level outcomes, which are broken down into discrete deliverables to form our **Backlog**.
- This sits alongside our Product and Support visions, strategies, roadmaps and backlogs
- Our [departmental mission](/1.-Welcome/Mission) links them together.
