# Ways of Working

While we encourage empowered autonomous self organizing teams there is a default ways of working teams are expected to adopt and can be broken down into 5 Engineering Pillars

 - Collaboration
 - Test First Delivery
 - Continuous Improvement
 - Ownership of Product Delivery  (TBD name)
 - Champion Quality (TBD name)

 The following will summarize the each Pillar represents and give examples of good practice of each one.

## Collaboration

. If you're blocked on making further progress, loudly and immediately raise this with your team and continue to do so until you have assistance in becoming unblocked. Do not spend more than an hour trying to solve a problem before asking someone else for help.

- Engineers should commit frequent small PR's
- Use Pull Requests
- don't defer communication until standup
- be loudly blocked
- [structured and descriptive commit messages](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages).

## Test First Delivery

## Continuous Improvement

## Ownership of Product Delivery

- Maintain up-to-date roadmap and backlog
- Readying work 3A's
- Bring forward uncertainty

##  Champion Quality 
- Teams must apply good scouting practices to improve the quality of every codebase they work on.
