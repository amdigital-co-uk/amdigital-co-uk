# Ways of Working

While we encourage empowered self organizing teams, there are some default ways of working teams are expected to adopt. These can be broken down into 5 Pillars

 - Collaboration
 - Test First Delivery
 - Driving Delivery 
 - Champion Quality (TBD name)
 - Continuous Improvement

 The following will summarize the each Pillar represents and give examples of good practices for each one.

 # Other topics
 - Unplanned work

## Collaboration

Empowered self organizing teams are expected to be proactively in their collaboration. Sharing information widely and loudly. On the lookout for opportunities to code together and consequently share knowledge and gain fast feedback on work.  

This list is by no means exhaustive but good examples of good collaborative practices:


- Don't defer communication until standup - [advice on how to do this]
- Be loudly blocked [give examples]
- [Cross team collaboration tips karen]
- Engineers should commit frequent small PR's
- [structured and descriptive commit messages](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages).
- Use Pull Requests (branching strategy) 

_For more information on this see our page [collaboration](5.-Collaboration-&-Ops)_

## Test First Delivery

//TODO reword
Empowered self organizing teams are expected to focus more on how we can test the system, rather than build the system. This may require investigations or asking for support outside your team.

This list is by no means exhaustive but good examples of good test first delivery practices:

 - TDD development
 - Automate all the things
 - Using 3A's as an opportunity to work out your test strategy.
 - Taking advantage of your Test Engineer to discover best practices around testing

## Own Product Delivery

//TODO reword
Empowered self organizing teams are expected to looking at way to take ownership of Product delivery. This means being on top of their Roadmaps and ensuring that any preparatory work is done before without Stakeholder prompting.

This list is by no means exhaustive but good examples of owning Product Deliver:

- Maintain up-to-date roadmap and backlog
- Readying work 3A's
- Bring forward uncertainty

##  Champion Quality 

//TODO reword
Empowered self organizing teams are expected to champion quality. Rather than "because we've always done it this way" it's striving to solve problems using good engineering practices. Being brave, coming up with innovative radical solutions if necessary.

This list is by no means exhaustive but good examples of championing quality:

- Teams must apply good scouting practices to improve the quality of every codebase they work on.
- Choosing the correct technology to solve the problem, which doesn't always means our sting to our defaults.
- Using bug fixes/features to improve our code coverage.

## Continuous Improvement

//TODO reword
Empowered self organizing teams are expected to looking at way to continuously improve the team and the platform. This doesn't mean 
they'll always be successful - we can learn more from our failures than our successes as long as we're willing to be honest and self critical with each other.

This list is by no means exhaustive but good examples of good collaborative practices:

 - Use retrospectives to critically analyzes how the team is working.
 - Give honest but conscientious feedback to each other.
 - Recognize technical debt, and make active plans to tackle it.
 - Recognize pain point and come up with active plans to resolve them (don't just leave it to the next retro).
