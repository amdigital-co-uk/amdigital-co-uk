This section contains an overview of practices, tools, principals, and patterns used by engineers in our teams, as well as guidelines for how to follow them. 

This is our "house style". All engineers must ensure that they understand and are able to follow these guidelines. For the most part they are not rules however. Guidelines must be followed until there is a reasonable case to not do so. In this instance you should ensure the guidelines are then updated if appropriate.

!!! note

    Specific implementation details should be included within the ReadMe files of the relevant repositories or subdirectories therein, however they may be referenced here for example purposes.

!!! danger
    
    **NEVER include any passwords or secrets, details of access mechanism, or interlectual property. **

    If you think it shouldn't be seen by a baddy, then don't put it in the playbook!
