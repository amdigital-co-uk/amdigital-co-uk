Welcome to our playbook. This document aims help our engineering, product, and design teams to operate within a clear framework of practices and achieve [our mission](/1.-Welcome/Mission).

## Who is this for?

This is for anyone in our team, anyone working with our team with an interest in how we work, anyone thinking about working in our team, or anyone with a passing interest in our values.

We have made this document public, so that we can be held to the standards set out.

## Do's and Don'ts

###DO 

:white_check_mark: **CONTRIBUTE** - this is a public document, and is owned by the whole department. We welcome comment form external readers. Team members should submit pull requests where they identify potential improvements, and collaborate with their team members to refine processes and standards. Details of how to contribute are [here](/1.-Welcome/Documentation-Guidelines/Platform-Development-Playbook).

:white_check_mark: **READ ME** - it's not just here to fill up space on the giant virtual bookshelf 

###DO NOT

:no_entry_sign: **PUT SECRETS HERE** - No secrets, passwords, or sensitive information. If you wouldn't give it to a baddy, don't put it here.

:no_entry_sign: **TROLL** - Sometimes we get things wrong. That's OK. If you want to criticise that is great, but it had better be helpful.
