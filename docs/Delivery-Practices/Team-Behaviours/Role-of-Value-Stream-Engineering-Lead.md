# Value Stream Engineering Lead

The leads are here to empower the teams to reach their full potential and produce innovative solutions that our customers love.

Here is a summary of our responsibilities and behaviors, this list isn't definitive or set in stone. As leads, we will need your clear and honest feedback on what is and isn't working so we can best empower you and the team.

## Team Responsibilities

* While the team is *responsible* for delivery, the lead is *accountable* for the delivery of the work.
* Lead is accountable for making sure the work done meets the required technical standard, and that any technical debt added is tracked and accounted for.
* The lead is responsible for the team's health; ensuring the team is happy, motivated, proud of the value they deliver to the business, and enjoying their work.
* The lead is there to support the team's improvement - this could be advising on the team's ways of working, their delivery practices, etc - note this doesn't mean to dictate the team's behaviors.
* The lead is there to provide technical support - they may not know the answer but will help in the discovery of the solution.
* In conjunction with the Product Managers, the lead is responsible for organising Design Sessions on large upcoming projects.
* Responsible for ensuring both streams are aligned technically.

## What to expect

* The lead isn't expected to attend every standup or retro, there will be times when the teams need to facilitate these sprint ceremonies without the lead.
* The lead is expected to provide support when requested by the team, but be mindful of the [wider responsibility of the lead](#wider-responsibilities-of-the-lead).
* Sometimes the lead will be focused on one team for an entire sprint, but always be open to supporting both teams at all times.
* Occasionally a lead will need to direct their focus outside of both sprint times for a sprint or more, but again will be able to provide support to both teams.
* The lead is expected to participate in all design sessions and keep the Engineering Leadership team abreast of decisions made.
* The lead is expected to perform sprint work and will provide extra assistance to the teams when there are absences.
* A lead should be realistic with their capacity but will aim to provide 20 hours of sprint work per sprint.

## Wider Responsibilities of the Lead

The leads roles are varied. Many responsibilities require them to share their focus each day. For example, line management - including 121s and ad-hoc personal support, participating in departmental strategy, and working with business stakeholders for future initiatives.

Context switching, preparation for, and taking actions from non-delivery meetings means that one 30-minute meeting can eat up a whole hour - or more.

Be mindful of this strain on their time and the cognitive load it creates. Remember that they are working hard in the background to support, empower, and enable the teams.

## Communication

If you need support from your lead you can request support in several ways:

* Ask them to attend your next standup.
* Ask them to join a mob.
* Post questions on your team channel.
* Send a Direct Message or ask for a call if you need some personal support.
* Check out their [working with me page](https://knowledgebase.platformdev.amdigital.co.uk/Directory/People/).
