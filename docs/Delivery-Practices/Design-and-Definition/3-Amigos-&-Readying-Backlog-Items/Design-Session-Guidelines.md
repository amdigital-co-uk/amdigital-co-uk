# Design Session Guidelines

A Design session is an opportunity for the team to come together to design a technical solution for a Roadmap item and get **Alignment** and **Confidence** in the approach. This document aims to share some guidelines on how we can maximize the opportunity.


## Inputs
Before the Design session, we should make sure we have done the necessary work to make sure the session is as successful as possible. The following is a non-exhaustive list of **Inputs** needed to help ensure success. We've broken down the responsibility to ensure these have been produced for the design session. 

### Product Manager

- **Stakeholder Map** - a visual representation of all the stakeholders of a roadmap item.
- **Clear problem outline** - a clear breakdown of what problem we're trying to solve.
- **Technical Limitations** - specifications of any specific technical limitation that must be followed to engineer the solution. 
- **Solution Vision** - a vision of how we will realize the solution this (e.g. low-fi designs)

### Tech Lead

- **Technical considerations** - a high-level idea of how to approach the solution with a rough idea of the area affected and research required to engineer the solution.
- **Session Plan** - a plan of the design session, you should consult with the following to produce this; Principal Engineer, Software Architect, and VP of Engineering. 
- **Existing Architecture**  - an understanding of existing platforms/infrastructure/design, this can be done in collaboration with others to produce this. 
- **Investigations** - given the technical considerations, any components/tools must be investigated and a report produced.
- **Session Length** - we should ensure the session length takes into account the size and complexity of the roadmap item (use your team to help choose a realistic time frame). 

> :bulb: **Tip:** The person responsible for the input isn't always the person generating the input, but they do need to coordinate the generation of the inputs. Use the Empowerment Team and your sprint team to help generate the inputs.


## During
Here are some tips to ensure the success of the design session

* As many key participants as possible in-person!
* Interrogate solutions proposed to understand problems needing solving.
* Be prepared to challenge ideas.
* The session plan should be led by Tech Lead.

## Outputs
Once the session has ended there is an expectation we would have produced the following outputs:

- **Low-fi delivery plan** - this should use ROM estimates only, the delivery plan should demonstrate how value will be delivered not when (e.g. critical path map)
- **RAID Log** - this should be an ongoing output during the whole of the design session, consider having a dedicated RAID logger to continually update the RAID log. 
- **Functional Design Definition** - this should detail how the solution will behave functionally.
- **Technical Design** - this should detail how we will go about engineering the solution and should include any additional investigations needed to validate the technical design.
- **High-level Test Plan** - this should detail the approach of how we will test the solution, this shouldn't be exhaustive but should contain the approach and any additional investigations needed.
- **Design & Definition Plan** - outline the design & readying process remaining, our "Road to confidence" 

###

## Outcomes
The following are the expected outcomes of a design session, if the team hasn't achieved the expected outcomes then it is an indication that further design work is necessary: 

- Aligned on & confidence in functional & technical design
- Aligned on a plan for design & definition
- Understanding of unknown and investigations required
- Stakeholders understand the route to problem resolution


> :bulb: **Tip:** Given we are a department that works remotely when setting up an in-person design session, consider viability of addressing multiple problems. But be considerate of WIP and make sure that you have the ability to work on the outputs produced.
