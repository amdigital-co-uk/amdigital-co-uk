Release notifications

When carrying out a release, it is good practice to let stakeholders know the release is about to happen, and what it will mean for them. 

What types of work require notification? 
Any work that involves a release, including:
•	Product features and changes, regardless of platform
•	Bug fixes that involve code changes
•	Technical improvements and infrastructure changes

How to notify colleagues of a release
•	Delivery team member posts to the Release Announcements channel (in the Platform Support team) ahead of release
•	Use team tags to alert stakeholders identified in your Release Plan
•	Confirm when the release has been completed successfully, or if there’s been an issue and you have to change course/roll back. 

Who are your stakeholders? 
Stakeholders should have been identified in the BLI planning/readying process, and captured in the Release Plan. 
Make sure you have thought about all colleagues who may be impacted by the release, not just the obvious ones! For example, to meet a request raised by CX, a change to the DAM may address a pain point for a particular customer e.g. for importing metadata. Production users may also benefit from the change, and should be informed of it. 

What to communicate
When communicating to stakeholders, think about their perspective and what they might need to know. Be sure to:
•	Provide a short summary of the change, including the area of the platform and whether it is part of a larger suite of changes.
•	Provide context behind the change. Stakeholders may not know the change is coming, or why! A brief note on practical applications can be useful. 
•	Whether there are any visible changes they’ll see as a result, including whether the change has been feature flagged. Even if there are no visible changes, letting stakeholders know that a release is taking place can help manage expectations in the event that there’s an issue. 
•	Note if any actions are required by the user in order to see the desired changes, e.g. re-promote or re-publish. 
If the release is part of a larger set of changes, the Product Manager should be in discussions with stakeholders throughout development, and will prepare accompanying Feature Notes . 

Example notifications
 
1.	A good level of detail:
Hi Quartex Internal Support we are about to release the fix for font colours in high contrast mode.
This should fix a few instances where font was not sufficiently contrasting when using the high contrast mode toggle.
This will require a republish for sites that’s users are using a screen reader.
2.	An example where valuable information was missing:
Hi Quartex Internal Support Yoshi are releasing a change that will improve accessibility when using keyboard focus visibility on video player. This is a visual change and will effect everybody. Will notify when release is complete.
In this scenario, a stakeholder had to ask what the visual change was.
 
3.	An example where contextual information was missing:
Morning Quartex Internal Support we are planning to perform an update to the Export Asset Metadata feature today. This will add an Asset ID column to any newly generated asset exports.

In this scenario, a stakeholder had to ask what the Asset ID was/how it was different from other IDs. They benefitted from a response that told them the reason for the change, and how it could be applied to their own use cases.
