This mini-framework is to be used in conjunction with the company-wide Working Practices Framework.

1. Guidance for hybrid working in the AM “Working Practices Framework” document should be followed, including:
    - Working from home is optional, and set-up and maintenance of an appropriate remote working space, along with travel to and from the office, is the responsibility of the employee.
    - When working remotely, we expect that employees are not simultaneously providing principal care of dependants.
    - When working remotely, individuals must have continuous access to a suitable internet connection.
    - Employees must continue to comply with all AM Corporate Policies while working remotely.

1. This Framework is built on trust and, to work effectively, employees must show courtesy to colleagues and, in particular, respect of each other's schedules and availability.
    - There are no core hours, but there is an expectation that employees are generally available for core Delivery Team meetings and collaboration (in the office or remotely) during times determined by the requirements of their role; such as Daily stand ups, Sprint planning and Backlog refinements. Exceptions are enabled by agreement, where impact is discussed and measured.
    - To be available for cross-team meetings with members of other divisions as required.
    - To be available as agreed to cover out of hours support.
    - Working location must be kept up to date and visible to all in Outlook.
    - Employees should be available to come into the office for meetings or specific activity if there is a business requirement.
    - It is encouraged that each team aligns in-office days. Subject to review this will initially suggested to coincide with sprint transition days (currently Tues and Weds).

1. All meetings are to be carried out in the most effective way possible, following guidance in AM's “Effective Meetings Toolkit”:
    - It is beneficial for certain meetings to be carried out in person, such as divisional team meetings and product discovery workshops. This should be stipulated in the meeting invite when it is set up, and at least a week in advance. Teams should engage with enablement group early to request attendance for in-office meetings.
    - Based on DMT examples and guidelines, Delivery teams should self-determine which meetings should be in person, and how they will measure the success of that -
    - If attending meetings virtually, use of video functionality is strongly encouraged. Where video is not possible or appropriate, attendees should actively participate using verbal cues.
