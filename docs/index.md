Welcome to our Playbook. This document aims help our engineering, product, and design teams to operate within a clear framework of practices and achieve [our mission](#our-mission).

This is for anyone in our team, anyone working with our team with an interest in how we work, anyone thinking about working in our team, or anyone with a passing interest in our values.

We have made this document public, so that we can be held to the standards set out.
