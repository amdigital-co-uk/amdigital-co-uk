Releases must:

- always be [documented with a release plan](Release-Plans)
- always be [communicated to stakeholders](/Ways-of-Working/Toolkit/Release-Notifications/)

If you are involved in releases, you must be familiar with these guides. They are likely to change regularly so make sure you keep up to date.
