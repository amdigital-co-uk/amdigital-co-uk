title: Technical Validation Review
---

## Objective

Ensure that large-scale work is periodically reviewed during long-running projects and prior to completion to verify alignment with department-wide best practices and technology strategy by the Principal Engineer.

## Requirements

The Principal Engineer must:

- test the developer experience and documentation by running the code.
- ensure that the deployment process follows default patterns. If deviations exist, ensure the reasons have been documented.
- verify that security practices adhere to the departmentâ€™s default standards. Any deviations must have been documented.
- confirm that code practices follow established default patterns. If there are exceptions, ensure justification has been documented.

Engineering Owner must:

- collaborate with Principal Engineers to ensure that periodic validation has occurred.
- take action to address and remediate any identified issues.


## Triggers

If an [Architectural Design](Architectural-Design.md) has been required for the problem, a Technical Validation Review will be needed. 
When creating an implementation plan, the delivery team and engineering owner should identify suitable points for this review. 

## Responsibilities

| Owner | Responsibility |
| - | - |
| Engineering Owner | Is **responsible** for ensuring that Technical Validation Review is planned and performed before the end of the project, and **accountable** or ensuring that Technical Validation results are actioned before the end of the project. |
| Principal Engineer| Is **responsible** for performing thorough and timely Technical Validation, providing clear and actionable feedback to the delivery team. |
