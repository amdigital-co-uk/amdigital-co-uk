title: Architectural Design
---

An architectural design describes the technologies used and how they will be implemented to solve a problem.

The objective of architectural designs is to:

-  ensure that good practice is adhered to
-  ensure that alignment is created between the team and other technical stakeholders
-  support [reliability impact](Reliability-Impact-Assessment.md) and [security impact](Security-Impact-Assessments.md) assessments.


## Architectural Design

- Using collaborative approach within team and wider technical stakeholders
- ensure use of defaults or rfc where deviating
- ensure chosen approach is well documented with ADRs

## Peer Review

Architectural designs must be reviewed by relevant technical stakeholders.

## Responsibilities

| Owner                 | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Engineering Owner     | The Engineering Owner  **accountable** for the architectural design and **responsible** for ensuring that designs created and documented, and that appropriate technical stakeholders are involved. |
| Delivery Team         | The Delivery Team are collectively **responsible** for supporting the creation of architectural designs |
| Technical Stakeholders| Various technical stakeholders, such as VP Engineering, Principal Engineer, are **accountable** for the overarching technical architecture of our technology estate, and **responsible** for ensuring that architectural designs support the technology strategy. |


## Triggers

- big work, regardless of use of defaults
- small work where there is deviation from defaults
