## Responsibility Matrix

**Responsibility Matrix** is an artefact consisting of mechanisms for managing and maintaining the responsibility matrix (usually referred to as a RACI) and typically includes key information and guidance for interacting with all personnel and stakeholders involved in a project of work. Initially produced during the discovery zone and forms part of product governance, and is transferred to delivery planning during the design and implementation zones. 

#### Accountable: 
The Delivery Lead is accountable for ensuring that the responsibility matrix is current, __maintained__ and __accessible__

#### Responsible 
All members of delivery teams assigned to the problem, as well as the problem owner are responsible for ensuring that the responsibility matrix is produced, current, accurately maintained and accessible 

#### Triggers
The delivery team responsible for a problem will need to determine and document when a responsibility matrix (or RACI) will need to be reviewed and updated, and as a consequence whether additional stakeholder identification, stakeholder mapping will need to take place.


#### Recommended Approach

1. Immediately proceeding the discovery zone, the delivery lead and delivery team review the product governance responsibility matrix, identifying any gaps, and produce a RACI
2. What are the responsibility mechanisms (i.e. how will responsibility matrixes be produced, what will the matrix look like and how will it be communicated)
3. What are the triggers (when will these mechanisms happen)
4. Who will be:
    - a. Responsible & Accountable for maintaining reporting mechanisms
    - b. Consulted and Informed, given each of the mechanisms
5. The Delivery Lead ensures that the responsibility matrix is documented and accessible by stakeholders 
6. The Delivery Team populate the matrix with current information on the project team and stakeholders 
    - typically includes
        - Name / Role 
        - RACI type 
        - Ability to impact project / availability  
        - Preferred communication type 
        - Communication frequency
7. The Delivery Team maintain the matrix as part of regular team activities.

Use the current default [RACI template] (link to tooling section of KB) as a starting point.
