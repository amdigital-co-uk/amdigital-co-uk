## Responsibility Matrix

**Responsibility Matrix** is an artefact consisting of mechanisms for managing and maintaining the **Responsibility Matrix** (usually referred to as a RACI) and typically includes key information and guidance for interacting with all personnel and stakeholders involved in solving the problem. Initially produced during the **Discovery Zone** and forms part of problem governance, and is transferred to **Delivery Planning** during the **AMPFlow Design and Implementation Zones**

#### Accountable: 
The Delivery Owner is accountable for ensuring that the responsibility matrix is current, maintained and accessible

#### Responsible 
All members of delivery teams assigned to the problem, as well as the problem owner are responsible for ensuring that the **Responsibility Matrix** is produced, current, accurately maintained and accessible 

#### Triggers
The delivery team responsible for a problem will need to determine and document when a **Responsibility Matrix** (or **RACI**) will need to be reviewed and updated, and as a consequence whether additional **Stakeholder Identification**, and **Stakeholder Mapping** will need to take place.
