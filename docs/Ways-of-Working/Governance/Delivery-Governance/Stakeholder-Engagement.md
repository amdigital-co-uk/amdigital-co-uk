  - requirements ellicitation and validation
  - managing expectations

  - mitigating risks, assumptions, issues and dependencies (RAID)
  - ensuring alignment with business goals 
  - facilitating effective decision-making

## Responsibilities

| Owner                 | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Delivery Owner        | The Delivery Owner is **accountable** for ensuring that effective stakeholder engagement is happening at appropriate times and the results are both accessible and effectively communicated with colleagues and stakeholders |
| Delivery Team         | The whole Delivery team is collectively **responsible** for effective stakeholder engagement |


## Triggers

Effective stakeholder engagement should consistently deliver value to the project, by enabling faster feedback loops resulting in the delivery of successful outcomes sooner, safer and happier.

The team responsible for a problem will need to determine and document why, how and when stakeholder engagements should occur. Here are some triggers that can prompt stakeholder engagement activities:

1. Project kickoff
2. Major milestones
3. Change requests
4. Risk, assumption, issues, dependency identification 
5. Critical issues
6. Decision points 
7. Deliverable reviews
8. Lessons learned
9. Quality assurance 
10. Feedback loops 
11. Celebrating successes


## Communication Plan

The team responsible for a problem will need to determine and document a communication plan for effectively engaging with stakeholders, ensuring expectations are clear and guidance is available / accessible to support effective engagement. 

A stakeholder communication plan could typically include the following: 

1. **Stakeholder Analysis** - identify all stakeholders involved in the project, including interests, expectations, influence and comunication preferences
2. **Objectives and Key Messages** - define communication objectives and key messages that need to be conveyed throughout the project lifecycle
3. **Communication Channels** - defining appropriate communication channels for reaching each stakeholder group e.g delivery governance artefacts: project health dashboards, synchronous or asynchronous project status updates, emails, dedicated stakeholder portals (teams).
4. **Frequency and Timing** - establish a communication schedule detailing when and how oftern updates will be provided to stakeholders. Ensure that communications are timely and aligned with project milestones and events.
5. **Content and Format** - determine the content and format of communication materials, ensuring they are clear, concise, and tailored to the needs of the inteded audience.
6. **Feedback Mechanisms** - establish mechanisms for solicitating feedback from stakeholders and providing opportunities for them to ask questions, share concerns and provide input. This could inlcude surveys, feedback forms, dedicated feedback sessions, or one-to-one meetings 
7. **Responsibilites & Roles** - clearly defined roles and responsibilies for communicating with stakeholders, including who who will be responsible for drafting communications, delivering messages, and responding to enquiries 
8. **Escalation Procedures** - outline procedures for escalating issues or cconcerns raised by stakeholders to the appropriate level of management or decision-makers for resolution 
9. **Risk Management** - identify potential communication risks and develop strategies for mitgating them. This could be addressing comunicaiton barriers, managing conflicts, or addressing stakeholder resistance 
10. **Evaluation & Improvement** - regularly evaluate the effectiveness of communicaiton efforts by gathering feedback from stakeholders and addressing whether communication objectives are being met. Use this feedback to make adjustments and improvements to the communication plan as needed
