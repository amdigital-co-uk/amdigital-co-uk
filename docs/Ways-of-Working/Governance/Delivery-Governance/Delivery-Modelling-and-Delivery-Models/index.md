## Delivery Status Reporting & Delivery Status Reports

**Delivery Modeling** is an event that requires all delivery teams collectively to plan and produce a model (or roadmap) to understand and set early expectations, dependencies, bottlenecks and perform speculative estimation for all medium term priorities (up to 12 months) . This event occurs typically during the discovery zone approximately once a quarter, but should be routinely reviewed and renewed if certain triggers are met

**Delivery Model** is an artefact produced by all delivery teams collectively, detailing the delivery model or timeline for up to 12 months. It should detail all medium term priorities, any key milestones, speculative estimation, dependencies and bottlenecks.  Although it's expressly caveated that this is not a reliable plan and doesn't constitute commitments

#### Accountable: 
The Delivery Lead is accountable for ensuring that delivery modelling is performed and delivery models produced are current, maintained and accessible

#### Responsible 
The Delivery Lead, Engineering Lead, Product Lead, Design Lead from each delivery team as well as the problem owner are responsible for facilitating the delivery modelling event, and ensuring delivery models produced are current, accurate well maintained and accessible

#### Triggers
The team responsible for each problem will need to determine, document and communicate out when delivery models need to be reviewed and updated, and as a consequence, when modelling should be conducted, and who will need to be present. This will typically occur at regular intervals, once per quarter OR when there's a major shift in priorities and the health of the delivery model becomes critical (red) 

#### Recommended Approach

1. Once per quarter during the **AMPFlow discovery zone** OR throughout the problem solving lifecycle when certain triggers are met. All delivery teams, selected delivery team members and at least the delivery lead produce a delivery model (roadmap) with typically a 12 month view ahead
2. What are the delivery modelling mechanisms (i.e how will delivery modelling events happen and what will the delivery models look like)
3. What are triggers (when will these mechanisms happen)
4. Who will be:
    1. Responsible & accountable for ensuring the models are current, accurate, maintaining documentation
    2. Consulted and informed, given the mechanisms and artefacts
5. The delivery lead ensures that this model is documented, accessible and shared with stakeholders, and delivery modelling review events are scheduled
6. The selected delivery team members collate information on all medium term priorities and populate the delivery model with the most current information including:
    1. key work items (or BLI's) and speculative estimates 
    2. key milestones 
    3. key risks and dependencies 
    4. resource requirements (therefore exposing any bottlenecks)
7. The delivery team update the delivery model as part of regular team activities, maintain documentation on delivery model health, and communicate out when any significant changes have occured that could benefit from a collective review and re-plan of the delivery model
