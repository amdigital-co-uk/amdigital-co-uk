## Design Planning & Design Plans

**Design Planning** is a procedure in which the delivery team develops a structured design plan detailing the design approach for a problem or solution. This procedure often occurs at the beginning of the **AMPFlow design zone** and should be continually reviewed and updated throughout the entire problem solving lifecycle.

**Design Plans** are artefacts produced and maintained by the delivery team and consists of mechanisms for managing and maintaining the plans and typically includes: detailed technical requirements, functional requirements, experiential requirements, test planning requirements, estimates and a DOT (direction of travel) (including resources)


## Accountable: 
The Delivery Owner is accountable for ensuring that design planning is performed and **design plans** and all artefacts produced as a result are maintained and accessible

## Responsible 
All members of delivery teams assigned to the problem, as well as the problem owner are responsible for ensuring that design plans produced are current, accurately maintained and accessible 

## Triggers
The delivery team responsible for a problem will need to determine and document when design plans need to be produced, reviewed and updated, and as a consequence, when and how design planning will need to occur. This will typically first occur at the beginning of the **AMPFlow design zone**, and will continue throughout the design and implementation zones. This will likely be when certain triggers are met, for example when there's a change to the design specification i.e new discovery, new requirements or when the health of the design plan becomes critical (red)


## Recommended Approach

1. Immediately proceeding the **Discovery Zone** the Delivery Team and Delivery Owner set out a detailed **Design Plan** consisting of design mechanisms and typically including technical requirements, functional requirements, UX, test planning, initial estimates, RACI, RAID log and a DOT (direction of travel) (including resources)
2. What are the design planning mechanisms (i.e how will design planning events happen, what will the design plans include and look like and how will they be communicated) (need to investigate tooling)
3. What are the triggers (when will these mechanisms happen)
4. Who will be:
    - responsible & accountable for maintaining delivery planning mechanisms and delivery plan artefacts
    - consulted & informed, given each of the mechanisms
5. The delivery Owner ensures that this plan is documented and accessible by stakeholders and that any review events are scheduled 
6. The delivery team populate the design plan with current design planning mechanisms and artefacts including:
    - Project governance plan
        - Health: Red, Amber, Green (RAG)
        - Responsibility matrix or RACI
    - Design Plan
        - design plan mechanisms
        - technical requirements
        - functional requirements
        - experiential requirements
        - test plan
        - early estimates
        - Direction of travel o timeline
        - Initial milestone plan
        - HL resource plan
        - RAID Log and mitigation plan
7. The delivery team continuously review, update and evolve the **Design Plan** throughout the **AMPFlow Design Zone** and **Implementation Zones** as part of regular team activities, and as and when certain triggers are met
