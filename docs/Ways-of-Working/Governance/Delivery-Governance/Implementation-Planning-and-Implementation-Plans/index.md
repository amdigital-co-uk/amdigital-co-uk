## Implementation Planning & Implementation Plans

**Implementation Planning** is a procedure in which the delivery team develops a structured implementation plan detailing the implementation approach for a project or solution. This procedure often occurs at the beginning of the AMPFlow design zone or as soon as enough is known about the solution and a plan is in place. It should be continually reviewed and updated throughout the entire problem solving lifecycle.

**Implementation Plans** are artefacts produced and maintained by the delivery team, and consists of a mechanism for implementation and typically includes status reporting artefacts and mechanisms, a prioritised backlog, a timeline and delivery schedule, detailed resourcing plan, RACI, RAID log


#### Accountable: 
The Delivery Lead is accountable for ensuring that **implementation planning** is performed and **implementation plans** and all artefacts produced as a result are maintained and accessible

#### Responsible 
All members of delivery teams assigned to the problem, as well as the problem owner are responsible for ensuring that implementation plans produced are current, accurately maintained and accessible 

#### Triggers
- The delivery team responsible for a problem will need to determine and document when implementation plans need to be produced, reviewed and updated, and as a consequence, when and how implementation planning will need to occur. 

- This will likely be at regular intervals, throughout the design and implementation zones, or when certain triggers are met, for example when a change in approach is required or the health of the implementation plan becomes critical (red)



#### Recommended Approach

1. Immediately proceeding design planning the __Delivery Team__ and __Delivery Lead __set out a detailed **implementation plan** consisting of **implementation mechanisms** and typically including the following: status reporting artefacts, a prioritised backlog, a timeline and delivery schedule, detailed resourcing plan, RACI and a RAID log and mitigation plan
2. What are the implementation planning mechanisms (i.e how will implementation planning events happen, what will the implementation plans include and look like, and how will they be communicated) (need to investigate tooling)
3. What are the triggers (when will these mechanisms happen)
4. Who will be:
    - responsible & accountable for maintaining implementation planning mechanisms and implementation plan artefacts
    - consulted & informed, given each of the mechanisms
5. The delivery lead ensures that the implementation plan is documented and accessible by stakeholders and that any review events are scheduled 
6. The delivery team populate the implementation plan with current implementation planning mechanisms and artefacts including:
    - Project governance artefacts
        - status reporting mechanisms and artefacts 
        - responsibility matrix or RACI
    - Implementation Plan
        - implementation mechanisms 
        - prioritised backlog 
        - timeline and delivery schedule / plan
        - RAID log and mitigation plan
        - milestone plan
        - detailed resourcing plan
7. The delivery team continuously review, update and evolve the implementation plan throughout the AMPFlow design zone and implementation zone as part of regular team activities, and as and when certain triggers are met
