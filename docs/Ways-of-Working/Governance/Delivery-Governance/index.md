## Delivery Status Reporting & Delivery Status Reports

Delivery Status Reporting is an event during which the Delivery Team share the status of their delivery plans with stakeholders. Reviews should happen at regular intervals, when a major change of status occurs, or after certain milestones. 

Delivery Status Reports are documents maintained by the Delivery Team that detail the status of delivery plans, so that stakeholders can easily find this information when needed. Report documents should be updated as and when relevant information is available.

**Accountable:** The Delivery Lead is accountable for ensuring that delivery status reporting is performed and that reports are maintained.  

**Responsible:** All members of delivery team assigned to the problem, as well as the problem owner are responsible for providing updates and ensuring that they are accurate and timely.

#### Triggers
The team responsible for a problem will need to determine and document when report updates are provided.
This may be both at regular intervals, after specific milestones, or when certain triggers are met, for example the health of the delivery plan becomes critical (Red).

#### Recommended Approach

1. During or immediately after *Design Planning*, the Delivery Team and Delivery Lead set out a status reporting plan
   1. What are the reporting mechanisms (i.e. how will Delivery Status Reporting events happen and what will reports look like)
   2. What are triggers (when will these mechanisms happen)
   3. Who will be:
      1.  Responsible & Accountable for maintaining reporting mechanisms 
      2.  Consulted and Informed, given each of the mechanisms 
2.  The Delivery Lead ensures that this plan is documented and shared with stakeholders, and that Delivery Status Review events are scheduled.
3.  The Delivery Team populate the Report with current Delivery Status information including:
    1.  Health: Red, Amber, Green (RAG) 
    2.  RAID log
    3.  Mitigation plan (where health is Amber or Red)
    4.  Responsibility Matrix
4.  The Delivery Team maintain the report as part of regular team activities.

Use the current default [Delivery Status Reporting templates] (link to tooling section of KB) as a starting point.
