## Delivery PLanning & Delivery Plans

**Delivery Planning** is a procedure in which the delivery team develops a well-organised **delivery plan** detailing the delivery **__approach__** for a project or solution. This process often occurs at the beginning of the AMPFlow design zone, and should be continually reviewed and updated throughout the entire problem solving lifecycle

**Delivery Plans** are artefacts produced and maintained by the delivery team, and includes a well structured **delivery approach** **design plan**, **implementation plan** and **warranty plan** that details how a project or solution will be delivered.

#### Accountable: 
The Delivery Lead is accountable for ensuring that delivery planning is performed and **delivery plans** and all artefacts produced as a result are __maintained__ and __accessible__

#### Responsible 
All members of delivery team assigned to the problem, as well as the problem owner are responsible for ensuring the delivery plans produced are current, accurately maintained and accessible 

#### Triggers
The delivery team responsible for a problem will need to determine and document when delivery plans need to be reviewed and updated, and as a consequence, when and how delivery planning will need to occur. This will likely be at regular intervals, after specific milestones or when certain triggers are met, for example when there's a new discovery, change in priorities or the health of the delivery plan becomes critical (red)

#### Recommended Approach

1. During or immediately proceeding the discovery zone the __Delivery Team__ and __Delivery Lead __set out a detailed **delivery plan** consisting of a **design plan**, **implementation plan** and **warranty plan**. Delivery models should provide guidance and form a foundation for producing effective delivery plans 
2. What are the delivery planning mechanisms (i.e how will delivery planning events happen, what will the delivery plans include and look like and how will they be communicated) (need to investigate tooling)
3. What are the triggers (when will these mechanisms happen)
4. Who will be:
    - responsible & accountable for maintaining delivery planning mechanisms and delivery plan artefacts
    - consulted & informed, given each of the mechanisms
5. The delivery lead ensures that this plan is documented and accessible by stakeholders and that any review events are scheduled 
6. The delivery team populate the delivery plan with current delivery planning mechanisms and artefacts including:
    - Project governance plan
        - Health: Red, Amber, Green (RAG)
        - Responsibility matrix or RACI
    - Milestone plan
    - Resource plan
    - RAID Log and mitigation plan
    - Design Plan
        - specification
            - technical plan / requirements
            - functional requirements
        - UX plan
        - test plan
        - early estimates
        - timeline / DOT 
        - resource plan
    - Implementation Plan
        - Prioritised backlog
        - Visual delivery plan (timeline or DOT)
    - Warranty Plan
- 7. The delivery team continuously review, update and evolve the delivery plan throughout the AMPFlow design zone and implementation zones as part of regular team activities, and as and when new information arrives 
- use the current default (Delivery Plan Templates) (link to tooling section of KB) as a starting point
