## Implementation Planning & Implementation Plans

**Implementation Planning** is a procedure in which the delivery team develops a structured **Implementation Plan** detailing the implementation mechanisms for a problem or solution. This procedure often occurs at the beginning of the **AMPFlow design zone** or as soon as enough is known about the problem and solution and a **Design Plan** is in place. It should be continually reviewed and updated throughout the entire problem solving lifecycle.

**Implementation Plans** are artefacts produced and maintained by the delivery team, and consists of a mechanism for implementation and typically includes **Status Reporting Artefacts** and mechanisms, a prioritised backlog, a timeline and delivery schedule, detailed resourcing plan, RACI, RAID log


#### Accountable: 
The Delivery Lead is accountable for ensuring that **implementation planning** is performed and **implementation plans** and all artefacts produced as a result are maintained and accessible

#### Responsible 
All members of delivery teams assigned to the problem, as well as the problem owner are responsible for ensuring that implementation plans produced are current, accurately maintained and accessible 

#### Triggers
The delivery team responsible for a problem will need to determine and document when **Implementation Plans** need to be produced, reviewed and updated, and as a consequence, when and how **Implementation Planning** will need to occur. 

This will likely be at regular intervals, throughout the **AMPFlow Design and Implementation Zones**, or when certain triggers are met, for example when a change in approach is required or the health of the **Implementation Plan** becomes critical (red)



#### Recommended Approach

1. Immediately proceeding **Design Planning** the Delivery Team and Delivery Lead** set out a detailed **Implementation Plan** consisting of **Implementation Mechanisms** and typically includes the following: status reporting artefacts, a prioritised backlog, a timeline and delivery schedule, detailed resourcing plan, RACI and a RAID log and mitigation plan
2. What are the **Implementation Planning Mechanisms** (i.e how will **Implementation Planning** events happen, what will the **Implementation Plans** include and look like, and how will they be communicated) 
3. What are the triggers (when will these mechanisms happen)
4. Who will be:
    - responsible & accountable for maintaining **Implementation Planning** mechanisms and **Implementation Plan** artefacts
    - consulted & informed, given each of the mechanisms
5. The delivery lead ensures that the **Implementation Plan** is documented and accessible by stakeholders and that any review events are scheduled 
6. The delivery team populate the **Implementation Plan** with current **Implementation Planning** mechanisms and artefacts including:
    - Project governance artefacts
        - status reporting mechanisms and artefacts 
        - responsibility matrix or RACI
    - Implementation Plan
        - implementation mechanisms 
        - prioritised backlog 
        - timeline and delivery schedule / plan
        - RAID log and mitigation plan
        - milestone plan
        - detailed resourcing plan
7. The delivery team continuously review, update and evolve the **Implementation Plan** throughout the **AMPFlow Design and Implementation Zones** as part of regular team activities, and as and when certain triggers are met
