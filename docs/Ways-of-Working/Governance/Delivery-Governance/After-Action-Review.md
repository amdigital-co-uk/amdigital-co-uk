## After Action Reviews

An **After Action Review** (review) is a point in time analysis of actions taken where there is opportunity for learning. This produces an **After Action Report** for the benefit of team reference, and stakeholder communication. This procedure can occur during any **AMPFlow** zone where there is perceived value in learning, but is required after any major milestones such as releases.

!!! note
    After Action Reviews are synonymous with "Wash Ups", "Mop Ups", "Post Mortems". After Action Review avoids terminology that assumes failure or damage. 

## After Action Reports
**After Action Reports** (report) are artefacts produced by the delivery team, and consist of an analysis of any action(s) where opportunity for learning is identified. It will typically include the a summary of the After Action Report event, a list of outcomes, identified improvements, and actions.

## Responsibilities

| Owner                 | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Delivery Lead         | The Delivery Lead is **accountable** for ensuring that reviews occur at appropriate times and that reports are produced and effectively communicated |
| Delivery Team         | The whole Delivery team is collectively **responsible** for performing reviews and involving appropriate stakeholders, and for producing reports |

!!! note
    Actions determined during the review process must be assigned an owner, who are responsible for performing or coordinating that action.

## Triggers

The team responsible for a problem will need to determine and document when **After Action Reviews** are occur. This will typically be after an action(s) where an opportunity for learning is identified  

## Recommended Approach

At any point throughout problem lifecycle when an opportunity for learning is identified, the **Delivery Team** facilitate an After Action Review event and produce an After Action Report.

!!! tip "Plan Ahead"

    Book your AAR meetings in early to ensure stakeholders can attend.

    Plan your meeting carefully in advance.

Teams can use any approach they wish to perform reviews and document outcomes.
