## After Action Reviews

An **After Action Review** (review) is a point in time analysis of actions taken where there is opportunity for learning. This produces an **After Action Report** for the benefit of team reference, and stakeholder communication. This procedure can occur during any **AMPFlow** zone where there is perceived value in learning, but is required after any major milestones such as releases.

!!! note
    After Action Reviews are synonymous with "Wash Ups", "Mop Ups", "Post Mortems". After Action Review avoids terminology that assumes failure or damage. 

## After Action Reports
**After Action Reports** (report) are artefacts produced by the delivery team, and consist of an analysis of any action(s) where opportunity for learning is identified. It will typically include a summary of the After Action Report event, a list of outcomes, identified improvements, and actions.

## Responsibilities

| Owner                 | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Delivery Owner         | The Delivery Owner is **accountable** for ensuring that reviews occur at appropriate times and that reports are produced and effectively communicated |
| Delivery Team         | The whole Delivery team is collectively **responsible** for performing reviews and involving appropriate stakeholders, and for producing reports |

!!! note
    Actions determined during the review process must be assigned owners, who are responsible for performing or coordinating that action.

## Triggers

The team responsible for a problem will need to determine and document when **After Action Reviews** should occur. This will typically be after an action(s) where an opportunity for learning is identified and should be pro-actively planned where possible

## Communication Plan

The team responsible for a problem will need to determine and document an **After Action Reviews** and **After Action Reports** communication plan, typically consisting of an approach to communicating with, and defining clear expectations for engagement with colleagues and stakeholders. 

## Considerations

At any point throughout the problem lifecycle when an opportunity for learning is identified, the **Delivery Team** facilitate an After Action Review Event and produce an After Action Report.

!!! tip "Plan Ahead"
    Identify during planning when After Action Reviews may be useful (i.e. what are the likely triggers) and communicate this with stakeholders.

    Book your AAR meetings in early to ensure stakeholders can attend and understand expectations

    Plan your meeting carefully in advance.

Teams can use any approach they wish to perform reviews and document outcomes. 

- Review the [toolkit](/Ways-of-Working/Toolkit) section for documented approaches, or perform your own research.
- Review the tooling section of the Knowledgebase for current [default document templates](https://knowledgebase.platformdev.amdigital.co.uk/Tools-and-Providers/AMPFlow-Governance/).
