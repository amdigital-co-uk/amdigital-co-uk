## After Action Review & After Action Reports

**After Action Reports** are artefacts produced by the delivery team, and consists of an analysis of any action(s) where opportunity for learning is identified. It will typically include the mechanisms for conducting **After Action Review** events and producing **After Action Report(s)**, a summary of the After Action Report event, a list of outcomes, identified improvements and actions

The team responsible for a problem will need to determine and document when **After Action Reports** are produced. This will typically be after an action(s) where an opoortunity for learning is identified  

#### Recommended Approach
1. At any point throughout the entire problem solving lifecycle when an opportunity for learning is identified the delivery team facilitate an After Action Review event and produce an After Action Report 
2. What are the **After Action Report** mechanisms (i.e. how will **After Action Review** events happen and what will **After Action Reports** look like)
3. What are the triggers (when will these mechanisms happen)
4. Who will be:
