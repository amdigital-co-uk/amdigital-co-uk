## Objective
The objective of RAID is to proactively manage and mitigate risks, assumptions, issues and dependencies throughout the project lifecycle.


## RAID
RAID is a project management tool used to identify, track, and manage key aspects that can impact the success of a project. 

- **Risks** - The objective of managing risks within RAID is to identify potential threats or uncertainties that could impact the project's objectives, timeline, budget, or quality. By identifying risks early on, the development team can implement strategies to mitigate or eliminate them, reducing the likelihood of negative consequences
- **Assumptions** - Assumptions are underlying beliefs or conditions that are taken for granted but have the potential to influence the project's outcomes. The objective of managing assumptions within RAID is to document and validate these assumptions to ensure that they are accurate and aligned with the project's goals. By addressing assumptions upfront, the team can avoid misunderstandings or misalignments that could derail the project
- **Issues** - Issues are problems or challenges that arise during the project execution that require resolution. The objective of managing issues within RAID is to track and address these issues in a timely manner to prevent them from escalating and impacting the project's progress. By actively managing issues, the team can minimize disruptions and keep the project on track towards its objectives
- **Dependencies** - Dependencies are relationships between project tasks or deliverables that dictate their sequence or interdependence. The objective of managing dependencies within RAID is to identify and track these relationships to ensure that tasks are executed in the correct order and dependencies are managed effectively. By understanding and managing dependencies, the team can optimize workflow and minimize delays in project execution

## RAID Planning Events

RAID Planning is an event and procedure in which the delivery team produces and/or updates a structured RAID log, detailing the current RAID items, the perceived impact, probability and strategies plans and/or actions for mitigation.

## RAID Logs

A RAID log is a document or tool used to capture, track and manage any identified RAID items. Typically RAID logs are used to proactively identify, assess, and manage risks, assumptions, issues, and dependencies throughout the problem lifecycle. 

By maintaining a comprehensive RAID log, delivery teams can improve their ability to anticipate and respond to challenges, minimise disruptions, and ultimately improve project outcomes.



## Responsibilities

| Owner                 | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Delivery Owner        | The Delivery Owner is **accountable** for ensuring that effective RAID management is happening at appropriate times and the results are both accessible and effectively communicated with colleagues and stakeholders |
| Delivery Team         | The whole Delivery team is collectively **responsible** for RAID identification, management and mitigation |
| Product Lead          | **Responsible** for participating in any RAID planning events where necessary, and by collating and sharing relevant product related insights that could lead to the identification of new RAID items |
| Engineering Owner     | **Responsible** for participating in any RAID planning events where necessary, and by collating and sharing relevant engineering related insights that could lead to the identification of new RAID items |
| Design Owner          | **Responsible** for participating in any RAID planning events where necessary, and by collating and sharing relevant design related insights that could lead to the identification of new RAID items |

## Triggers
Typical triggers for RAID include:

- **Project kickoff**
- **Requirement Gathering**
- **Design Phase** 
- **Implementation Phase** 
- **Resource Allocation**
- **Technology Selection** 
- **Change Requests** 
- **Project Reviews** 


## Communication Plan

Delivery teams are responsible for ensuring relevant stakeholders and/or colleagues are informed about the status of key RAID items and any actions being taken that could potentially impact the project, other delivery teams plans or stakeholders and other departments.

RAID communication plans typically include and document:

1. **Communication Channels** - with delivery teams: via regular team meetings or RAID planning events or with stakeholders: via project status updates and reports, ad-hoc communications to address urgent or critical RAID items, 
2. **Content & Format** - RAID item summary, detailed decriptions, action items and trends in RAID dat over time
3. **Escalation Process** - defined escalation process for addressing high-priority or critical RAID items that require immediate attention or resolution 
4. **Feedback Mechanism** - encourage feedback from stakeholders and team members on the effectiveness of RAID communication and any improvements or suggested adjustments required
5. **Review & Continuous Improvement** - regularly review the effectiveness of the RAID communication plan, gathering feedback from stakeholders and team members and identify opportunities for improvement

!!! Note
    Not all RAID items need to be communicated to colleagues and/or stakeholders, and in some situations can confuse rather than inform a stakeholder. Reporting on RAID should be tailored for the appropriate audiences, focussing on the key items of most concern or perceived impact.


## Recommended Approach

- Review the [toolkit](/Ways-of-Working/Toolkit) section for documented approaches, or perform your own research.
- Review the tooling section of the Knowledgebase for current [default document templates](https://knowledgebase.platformdev.amdigital.co.uk/Tools-and-Providers/AMPFlow-Governance/).
