title: Support Handover
---

## Objective

Ensure that the solution that has been released can continue to be supported, minimising the need for investigation and re-learning, and the likelihood of impediments being caused by knowledge gaps.

## Planning and Performing Handovers

During the warranty period, the delivery team will prepare the support team to adopt ongoing maintenance of the solution by providing a handover. 

The nature of the handover and approach taken will vary, and the delivery team must collaborate with the *support team* to plan and execute it.

The handover must be completed before the end of the warranty period, but can be started at any point, even while implementation is ongoing if it makes sense to do so.

!!! warning "Small Increments"
    Not all solutions implemented by a delivery team will require a support handover, particularly if it is a small incremental of value. This should be discussed, agreed, and documented.

!!! Danger "Failure to handover"
    The warranty period will continue until the handover is complete. 


## Responsibilities

| Owner                 | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Engineering Owner     | The Engineering Owner  **accountable** for the effective planning and execution of the support handover.  |
| Delivery Team         | The Delivery Team are collectively **responsible** for ensuring that the knowledge they have accumulated during the design and implementation of the solution is effectively documented and made clear and available to the support team and the wider department.  |
| *Support Team*        | The Support Team are **responsible** for coordinating with the delivery team to plan and execute the handover, and must be **consulted**.   |


## Triggers

The need for a warranty period should be determined during [delivery planning](../Delivery-Planning/).

The warranty plan must be produced and adapted throughout the implementation process, and must be agreed and communicated as alongside [release planning](../Problem-Governance/Release-Planning.md), and in advance of any releases.
