title: Problem Ownership
---

Throughout the problem lifecycle, the following key responsibilities are defined. The appropriate time to do so may vary, and in many cases is outlined in **AMPFlow** governance.

Every individual assigned any problem ownership is **accountable** for effective succession of responsibilities in the case of planned absence, and **responsible** for limiting the impact unplanned absence.
