## Challenge Mapping Techniques

Challenge mapping is the practice of identifying and communicating potential and current challenges relating to the problem lifecycle, such that they can be managed: accepted, removed, or mitigated. 

Challenge mapping is a continuous process, as new challenges will emerge, and existing challenges will evolve. 

A well established technique for challenge mapping is a *RAID Log*.

### RAID
- Risks
- Assumptions
- Issues
- Dependencies

**RAID Mitigation** is a procedure in which the delivery team produces a plan for mitigating against captured RAID items. This typically occurs the very moment you define a problem to be solved, and should be continually reviewed and updated throughout the entire problem solving lifecycle

**RAID Log** is an artefact produced and maintained by the delivery team and includes a clear break down of RAID items, their RAG status, potential impact, likelihood, mitigation strategies and plans for each where applicable 

#### Accountable: 
The Delivery Owner is accountable for ensuring that the RAID log is produced and accessible

#### Responsible 
All members of delivery team assigned to the problem, as well as the problem owner are responsible for ensuring the RAID log produced is current, accurately maintained and accessible 

#### Triggers
The delivery team responsible for a problem will need to determine and document when RAID logs need to be produced, reviewed and updated, and as a consequence, when and how RAID mitigation will need to occur. This will likely be at regular intervals, after specific milestones or when certain triggers are met, for example when there's a new discovery, change in priorities or the health of RAID items become critical (red)

#### Recommended Approach

1. As soon as a problem has been defined the Delivery Team setup and populate a **RAID Log**, and produce a **RAID Mitigation** plan which includes mechanisms for maintaining the log, and producing mitigation plans for RAID items 
2. What are the **RAID Mitigation** Mechanisms (i.e how will **RAID Mitigation** events happen, what will the **RAID Log** include and look like, and how will it be communicated) 
3. What are the triggers (when will these mechanisms happen)
4. Who will be:
    - responsible & accountable for maintaining the RAID log mechanisms and artefacts
    - consulted & informed, given each of the mechanisms
5. The Delivery Owner ensures that the **RAID Log** is documented and accessible by stakeholders and that any review events are scheduled 
6. The delivery team populate the **RAID Log** with current known Risks, Assumptions, Issues and Dependencies and known details which typically include:
    - RAID type
    - Description
    - Potential impact
    - Liklihood (or probability)
    - Mitigation plan
7. The delivery team continuously review and update the **RAID Log** and **RAID Mitigation** mechanisms throughout the full problem solving lifecycle as part of regular team activities, and as and when certain triggers are met
