![RAID Mitigation & RAID Logs ](../delivery-governance.png)

## Objective

Proactively and continuously identify and communicate potential and current challenges relating to the problem lifecycle, such that they can be managed: accepted, removed, or mitigated. 

## Challenge Mapping

Challenge mapping is a continuous process, as new challenges will emerge, and existing challenges will evolve. 

The practice is performed by the delivery delivery team, although any stakeholder can present challenges for the team to consider.

Challenges must be identified, categorised (e.g. Risk, Assumption, Issue, Dependency), and quantified, and documented. This "map" of challenges provides vital information that can help throughout the problem lifecycle, particularly during discovery and continuous delivery planning.

## Responsibilities

| Owner | Responsibility |
| - | - |
| Delivery Owner    | Is **accountable** for ensuring challenge maps are documented and communicated effectively |
| Product Lead      | Is **responsible** for creating and maintaining challenge maps during discovery |
| Delivery Team     | Are **responsible** for creating and maintaining their challenge maps, and **accountable** for ensuring challenges are considered during throughout the problem lifecycle |

## Triggers

Challenges should be documented as soon as they are known, throughout the problem lifecycle.

The delivery team must identify appropriate times to collectively review and update their challenge map, so that it is kept fresh and relevant, and can be effectively used for planning.

## Considerations

A well established technique for challenge mapping is a [RAID Log](/docs/Ways-of-Working/Toolkit/RAID.md).
