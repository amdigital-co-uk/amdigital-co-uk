title: Solution Design

Solution Design is the process of defining and designing a software solution for a business, product or user problem. 

The objective is to fully understand and articulate all aspects of the planned solution. 

## Components of Solution Design 

Outputs of solution design will include but are not limited to:

-	Functional design
-	UI/UX design, such as wireframes or user flows 
-	Impact assessments for thematic areas such as accessibility, security and business change
-	Decision records
-	Detailed backlog items, with implementation plans, test plans and acceptance criteria

Solution design will be iterative and likely to go through several rounds before design is considered complete. For example, a UX Designer may create some low-fi wireframes to visualise the proposed changes, and share these wireframes with stakeholders before refining the designs and creating hi-fi versions based on feedback received. 

Tools such as [Example Mapping](../../Toolkit/Example-Mapping.md) can be very useful to help determine the scenarios you need to plan for,  and backlog items you need to define. 

Solution design is considered complete when:

-	the [Problem Owner](../../Problem-Ownership/#problem-owner) has verified the planned solution addresses the problem
-	the Product Lead has verified the planned solution is aligned with product strategy
-	the Engineering Lead has verified the planned solution is aligned with technical strategy
-	all backlog items have been readied

## Responsibilities

| Owner             |   Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Problem Owner     |	The person accountable for ensuring the planned solution addresses the defined problem |
| Product Lead      |	The person accountable for ensuring the planned solution is aligned with the overarching product strategy |
| Engineering Owner	| The person accountable for ensuring the planned solution is aligned with the overarching tech strategy |
| UX Lead	        |   The person responsible for creating UI/UX design outputs |
| Delivery Team     |	The group responsible for conducting and completing all solution design activities and outputs, and ensuring designs are fully explored and validated |

## Triggers

Teams can start thinking about solution design at any point, however it can only be kicked off in earnest when:
•	The problem definition is complete and the problem has been effectively prioritized
•	A high-level or broad requirements specification has been created
•	A sensible solution path has been determined through technical discovery

## Communication

Communicating designs to stakeholders and validating the planned approach is an integral part of solution design. 

Plan when you will check in with stakeholders, and what you want to talk to them about. 

Never conduct solution design in a bubble!
