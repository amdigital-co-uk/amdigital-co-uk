title: Problem Governance
---


Problem Governance describes the way that we identify problems and determine solutions, and the systems we use for doing this. 

By “problems” we do not just mean Product problems. Technical problems, Support problems and Operational/Business problems can also be approached using the same systems.

Problem Governance helps ensure problems are approached thoughtfully, with a clear understanding of what success will look like and who will benefit, regardless of where the problem has originated.
