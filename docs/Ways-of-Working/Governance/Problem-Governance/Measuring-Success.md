title: Planning and Measuring Success
---

How do you know if your work is valuable if you don’t have a sense of what success looks like? Planning and Measuring Success enables you to define success for a proposed solution, and how you will measure it. 

The objectives of planning and measuring success are to:
-   set the criteria by which success of the solution will be measured, and 
-   ensure effective steps are taken to monitor and review success after implementation. 

## Planning Success

In order to understand how effective the planned solution is at addressing the original problem and adding value to the business, it’s important to set quantitative and qualitative measures, which can be tested, before the solution is released. 

Think about different types of measures that can indicate success, such as usage analytics, performance metrics, or customer and user feedback. It’s important to clarify when and how often you expect to check success indicators. 

An effective tool for setting success criteria can be OKRs, where the key results are time-bound goals you want to achieve. 

## Measuring Success

Based on the success plan, the problem owner and delivery team must ensure they:
-	Put the planned measures in place
-	Ensure they have planned time to check the measures or gather feedback
-	Ensure they have planned time in to review the measures and discuss both the implications and next steps
-	Feed results of success measures back to stakeholders. 


## Responsibilities

Owner	        | Responsibility    |
Problem Owner	| The person accountable for ensuring a suitable success plan is defined and carried out.   |
Delivery Team   | The group responsible for ensuring the success plan is implemented effectively.           |

## Triggers

Success planning can begin when:

-	The problem has been defined
-	High level requirements have been captured
-	A preferred solution has been identified

Success measurement can begin once the initial solution has been released.
