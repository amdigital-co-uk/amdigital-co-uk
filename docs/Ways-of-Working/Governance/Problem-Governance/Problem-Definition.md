title: Problem Definition
---

The objective is to create a clear and robust definition for your problem, and demonstrate that it is valid.

Clear and robust definitions enable:
- alignment on what the problem is
- ensuring that we are solving valid and important problems
- ensuring that appropriate solutions are designed and implemented

## Components of Defining a Problem

A good problem definition can appear simple, but it may take many discovery conversations and analyses before the problem is fully understood and can be described effectively.

A good problem definition comprises:

- A one-page validation canvas, which contains a succinct description of the problem and the value of solving it for affected users and customers (including a description of who these are), as well as for the business. Business value is essential for validating the problem – solving the problem should bring tangible benefits to the business, e.g. through growth, efficiency, strategic positioning, or furthering our mission.
- A hypothesis that states the problem and any supporting knowledge or assumptions, alongside a short, measurable description of the value expected to be gained by solving the problem. The chosen solution should aim to prove this hypothesis.
- A stakeholder map, which outlines the people impacted by the problem and those who may influence its resolution.

!!! note "Problem Validation"

    **Not all problems are valid!**
    
    Whilst every person’s problems are real, not all problems are problems that our Platform teams, or our products, should solve. If you’re struggling to define the problem, or it doesn’t relate back to business or department strategies, it may be something best put to one side. If the problem reoccurs, it’s worth revisiting – maybe the landscape has changed since it was last looked at.

## Responsibilities

| Owner | Responsibility |
| - | - |
| Problem Owner | The person accountable and responsible for defining the problem  |
| Product Manager | A Product colleague is responsible for peer reviewing the problem definition and providing feedback. A second pair of eyes can help to explore assumptions and consolidate the understanding of value. |
 
## Triggers

Your problem definition is likely to evolve alongside [discovery](Problem-Discovery.md) activities, and should be directly informed by them.

Problem definition is essential before you can go on to exploring [requirements](./Requirements-Gathering.md) and [designing solutions](./Solution-Design.md).
