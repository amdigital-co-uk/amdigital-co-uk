## **Welcoming New Talent: Making First Impressions Count**

Embarking on a journey with a new company marks a pivotal step in a colleague's professional trajectory. For the newcomer, it represents a mix of anticipation, inquisitiveness, and understandably, a touch of apprehension about integrating into a new environment. From the company's perspective, it's an opportunity to bring fresh insights, innovative skills, and renewed energy into the fold. Given this mutual significance, it's paramount that we provide a seamless and enriching onboarding experience.

### **The Importance of Onboarding**

A meticulously crafted onboarding process goes beyond merely introducing a new colleague to the company's tools and workflows. It sets the stage for their entire journey with the organization. Through this process, we convey our ethos, values, and the paramount importance we place on every colleague. Furthermore, a wholesome onboarding experience can significantly elevate a newcomer's confidence, foster optimal productivity, and instill a profound sense of belonging.

### **Our Onboarding Philosophy**

At the core of our approach is a simple yet cardinal tenet: onboarding is paramount. Throughout the onboarding phase, supporting the integration of our new colleague becomes our primary focus, taking precedence over other regular duties. This approach is our testament to the future, ensuring our newest colleagues embark on their journey equipped with all the requisite knowledge, tools, and support they deserve.

### **Onboarding Checklist: Your Blueprint for Success**

To ensure clarity and efficiency in this critical phase, we've curated an onboarding checklist. This comprehensive guide is designed to span the entirety of the onboarding journey. As line managers, create an individual version of this checklist for our new colleague and monitor its completion at every stage.

The checklist unfolds through five meticulously crafted phases:

- **Pre Start** - This two-week period is all about preparation, setting the stage for the colleague's official start at AM.
- **Arrival** - In these initial hours, we focus on introducing our new colleague to the AM environment and ensuring they feel genuinely welcomed.
- **Orientation** - Spanning the first few days, this phase is about helping our new colleague settle into their role, acquainting them with their team, and laying the groundwork for their future contributions at AM.
- **Acclimation** - Over the next few weeks, we aim to deepen their grasp of AM's operations, our product range, and our foundational methodologies.
- **Immersion** - In the months that follow, the goal is to bolster their confidence and expertise, immerse them in our tech ecosystem, and ensure they're seamlessly integrated into our business processes.
