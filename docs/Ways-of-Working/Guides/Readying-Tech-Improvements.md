# Definition of Ready
Note: The definition of ready should be considered a guide rather than a set of hard rules. The artefacts actually needed will vary depending on the nature of the backlog item. It is up to the 3 Amigos team to determine what readiness means for each backlog item as they go through the definition processes.

Ready Features and Change Backlog Items should:

1. Meet [INVEST](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/invest/) criteria and 
1. Include the following artefacts:
    1. [Problem Statement](/Delivery-Practices/Design-and-Definition/3-Amigos-&-Readying-Backlog-Items/Problem,-Value,-Solution-Statements)
    1. [Value Proposition](/Delivery-Practices/Design-and-Definition/3-Amigos-&-Readying-Backlog-Items/Problem,-Value,-Solution-Statements)
    1. [Solution Executive Summary](/Delivery-Practices/Design-and-Definition/3-Amigos-&-Readying-Backlog-Items/Problem,-Value,-Solution-Statements)
   1. Measures for success and mechanisms for producing metrics
   1. Technical requirements, such as:
       1. Behaviours needed from tools and teams
    1. Non-functional requirements including:
        1. [Non-functional acceptance criteria](/Delivery-Practices/Design-and-Definition/3-Amigos-&-Readying-Backlog-Items/Non%2DFunctional-Requirements) (above and beyond platform-wide standards)
        1. [Privacy Impact Assessment](/Delivery-Practices/Design-and-Definition/3-Amigos-&-Readying-Backlog-Items/Privacy-Impact-Assessments)*
        1. [Security Impact Assessment](/Delivery-Practices/Design-and-Definition/3-Amigos-&-Readying-Backlog-Items/Security-Impact-Assessment)*
        1. [Accessibility Impact Assessment](/Delivery-Practices/Design-and-Definition/3-Amigos-&-Readying-Backlog-Items/Accessibility-Impact-Assessment)*
    1. [Architectural design]()
    1. [Risks, Assumptions, Issues, and Dependencies](/Delivery-Practices/Design-and-Definition/3-Amigos-&-Readying-Backlog-Items/Risk,-Assumptions,-Issues,-&-Dependencies)
    1. Rationalisation - any sporting information that provides context to the artefacts above (for example, a decision log)
