## Who is this for?

This document is aimed at staff engineers, as wells as anyone within the organisation who may be working with staff engineers.

## Points to cover

- Types of work
- How to progress various types of work
- services offered
- what to include Staff Engineers in
    - Design sessions
    - Delivery updates
- planning and modelling
- time booking
- Staff engineers need to engage with all teams

## Overview

Staff Engineers work across all areas of the department and our entire technology estate. They are responsible for supporting all engineering teams, and maintaining a good working knowledge of the platforms and systems the department is responsible for. Staff Engineers are also expected to work both independently and collaboratively on a range of projects to improve the departments suite of engineering tools, and more generally improve our effectiveness.

Staff Engineers will spend much of their time working in the Support Hub as part of the Engineering Support function, but should also be expected to spend significant portions of their time working with other teams.

Staff Engineers will be explicitly working within the Support Hub and participating in team activities, or explicitly embedded in another delivery team and temporarily be part of that team's structure and participating i it's activities.

## Types of work

A staff engineer can expect to engage in a number of different types of work.

### Project work

Planned work, could involve improvements to tooling or general support team work.

Should be treated as Support Hub work items, which will improve visibility and provide opportunities to collaborate. It doesn't necessarily mean that other Support team members are available or expected to participate, though this shouldn't be ruled out either!

### Research and investigations

This could be research or investigation into how to solve a specific problem, which would typically be done with the intention of contributing to subsequent technical design sessions with another delivery team. This might also be done to support a Product Manager where a problem has not yet been assigned to a specific delivery team.

Should also be treated as Support Hub work items.

### Technical design support

This will usually be a specific meeting or series of workshops. A staff engineer can use their existing domain or technology expertise to help a delivery team create a technical design for some upcoming work.

Even when they lack technical extpertise in a relevant area, participating in technical design sessions (or being updated with the outcomes) can be an effective way for staff engineers to develop and maintain their domain knowledge across areas of our technical estate they are less familiar with.

It is expected that such sessions would appear as events in the individual staff engineerr's calendar, which should be sufficient to communicate availability.

### Delivery team support

A staff engineer will often spend some time embedded within a delivery team. This will often be a natural follow-up to help implement something they have helped in the design phase of. It could also be providing practical support to a team working with a particular technology or part of the domain that the staff engineer has expertise with, or it could simply be a way of providing additional software engineering resource to a team that needs it.

The staff engineers time and work should be managed using whatever mechanisms the team they are joining already uses.

## Working with Staff Engineers

Staff engineers can provide support to teams in a number of ways.

TODO: expand on the below bullet points, provide examples

- Domain expertise
- Technical expertise (e.g. particular languages, technologies, etc)
- Design consultation
- Technical leadership
- Additional resource to help implementation of specific projects

## TODO : Other documentation

- Working with me document in KB
    - Revisit with the above in mind
    - Add in section for expertise areas (and knowledge gaps!)
    - Perhaps specific areas I know I need to learn more about?
- Documentation directory in KB
    - Link to Staff Eng projects in Support AzDo area
    - Link to Staff Eng priorities in Miro
