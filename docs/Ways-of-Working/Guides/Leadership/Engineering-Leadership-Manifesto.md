## Manifesto Statements

I lead from the back, as a [servant leader](Engineering-Leadership-Guide.md).

I am a student of leadership.

I am a missionary not a mercenary. I evangelise our mission, vision and values.

I am never going to know less than I know right now.

I am constantly learning and developing my own expertise. Curious and investigative. Brave and willing to explore new ways.

I understand that my colleagues are constantly learning, and nurture their curiosity and bravery and support their career growth.

I have strong opinions, loosely held. My view may be distinctive and and unpopular. The best outcome is being proven wrong, and I actively seek to disprove my views and hypotheses, in the name of learning and maturing.

I look beyond the immediate, with my focus mainly in the medium and long term.

I act with kindness. In absolutely every situation.

I am open and honest, while acting with integrity and trust. I don't mask or warp the truth, but keep confidentiality as sacred.

I am a coach and an active listener. I ask more questions than I answer.

I distribute my responsibilities and the responsibilities of my team, so that I am never a single point of failure.

I have integrity. Demonstrating the behaviours I expect of others, and that are expected of me.

I am accountable for myself and my team.

And by extension I and a student of:

## Duties

Each type of leadership role has specific duties, and the system of work carries further duties for certain leadership roles. 

These are generic duties that apply to everyone in any engineering leadership role: 

- Succession planning.
- Seeking Feedback.
- Giving clear and timely feedback to your colleagues around you.
- Report and proactively mitigate problems as they occur.
