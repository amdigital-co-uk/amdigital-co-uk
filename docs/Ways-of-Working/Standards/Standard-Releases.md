title: Guide - Releases
---

Releases must:

- always be [documented with a release plan](Guide-Release-Plans.md)
- always be [communicated to stakeholders](Guide-Release-Notifications.md)

If you are involved in releases, you must be familiar with these guides. They are likely to change regularly so make sure you keep up to date.
