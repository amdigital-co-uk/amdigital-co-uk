## Introduction

We follow the principles of DevOps culture and in particular: [Flow](1.-Flow/), [Feedback](2.-Feedback/), and [Continuous Learning](3.-Conintuous-Learning/). Everyone in the department plays a critical role in this and is therefore expected to have a thorough understanding of it.

You can read more about Flow, Feedback and Continuous Improvement at AM in this section, but are encouraged to explore these topics more broadly. A simple starting point can [be found here](https://itrevolution.com/articles/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/).

### Continuous Collaboration and Communication

We communicate with each other continually and understand that this is central to [Flow](1.-Flow/), [Feedback](2.-Feedback/), and [Continuous Learning](3.-Conintuous-Learning/) and our overall [mission](#our-mission) success, especially as a remote and distributed team. We make a noise when blocked, and do not wait to seek support or share progress and we don’t wait for updates to come when we have questions. We work together to solve problems and share knowledge as we go to prevent dependencies and silos.

### Testing First: AKA _Testing in mind from the very beginning_

We always try to understand how we will test that something is working before we create solutions. Testing starts at the design stage. We use Test Driven Development, and test automation for unit, integration, UI and end-to-end test, but we also validate with exploratory and manual testing too. The entire delivery team participates in testing and we ensure that test engineers are always engaged with.

### Create Evolving Plans: AKA _Continuously Plan and Re-Plan_

We plan, and re-plan our short, medium, and long-term objectives. Each product delivery team has its own roadmap and backlog. We are responsible for consulting with stakeholders and informing them of the progress on the objectives. As a team we are all responsible for delivering our objectives. We work autonomously and are empowered to find the most effective ways of delivering the best solutions.  

### Champion quality

We value quality because we understand its impact on sustainable solutions. We seek support of others to improve our work. We define and our standards and challenge each other when they aren’t met. We encourage innovation so our standards and techniques can evolve, and our quality improves.

### Continuous Improvement (Experimentation & Learning)

We strive for greatness but understand the value of iterative and incremental improvement. We learn from our failures and encourage experimentation. We challenge ideas and never take a solution on merit. We ask difficult questions and respect all opinions. We accept honest and constructive feedback and give it to others.  

### Individual Responsibility

Each team member is empowered to perform their work without interference. We aim to provide clarity on expected standards, and we expect team members to work autonomously within these guidelines.  

Beyond the standard expectations specific to each role, each team member is individually responsible for:

- Adhering to our practice values
- Managing their own time and workload in close collaboration with their team  
- Proactively keeping themselves engaged – there is always somewhere you can be helpful, don’t wait to be asked
- Understanding what is required of them
