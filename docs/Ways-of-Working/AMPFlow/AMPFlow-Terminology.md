Title: AMPFlow Terminology
---

This section describes the meaning and purpose of the structural components of the delivery system.

## Goals & Tenets

**AMPFlow** is guided by Goals and Tenets. 

*Goals* set out the purpose of the delivery system and provide a way of qualifying if the system is effective. 

*Tenets* set out the values that guide what goes into a system. Tenets can include:

1. Principals: core beliefs held by the organisation acting within the delivery system. These guide the system’s facets & mechanisms and how they are used.
1. Ideals: situational relevant values that cannot/should not be enforced. These guide the actions taken by actors work as they work within the system.
3. Laws: policies, regulations, and relevant legal restrictions that the system, solutions, and actors must obey.
   
## Zones

The delivery system is broken down into familiar “zones”, which encapsulate parts of the whole system, and each of which has an objective. 

The zones are sequentially placed to reflect the initial order they would typically occur. However the model does not prohibit information or action flowing from any zone to another nor action occurring simultaneously in any zone.

In typical delivery systems (or SDLCs) zones may be referred to as “Phases”. Given that phases infers a linear sequence, **AMPFlow** replaces this terminology.

## FLOW

FLOW is the core and primary component of the delivery system. Illustrating the high level direction of information and action within the delivery system, aiding in planning and navigation (where).

Flow is agnostic of how, who, or what. It simply aids planning and navigation.

## Artefacts, Responsibilities & Mechanisms

This is the what, how, and who; the specifics of how to operate, who is involved, and what is produced to enable FLOW.

1.	Artefacts (what) i.e. tangible outputs.
2.	Responsibilities (who), e.g. RACI matrices, stakeholder maps.
3.	Mechanisms (how) refers to operating techniques or practices, and provides guidance or instruction.

## Governance

Governance outlines the artefacts, responsibilities and mechanisms that actors must adhere to in each of the delivery system’s zones. Governance provides the controls of the delivery system. 

The more artefacts, responsibilities and mechanisms that exist within the system’s Governance, the more closed a system is.

The governance may also specify has interfaces between each of the zones. Zone interfaces outline the criteria that must be met in order to commence work in that zone. Zone interfaces help enforce controls, and enable downstream work to occur more effectively. However, such interfaces are gates which reduce adaptability and Implementation linearity, and therefore should be minimised.

## Toolkit

The Toolkit contains all of the “tools” (mechanisms, responsibilities, and artefacts) that may be used in one or more zones by actors as they see fit. 

The toolkit is not controlled and continually evolves. Actors will determine the tools they wish to use based on experience and experimentation and the nature of the problem, and may be guided by consultation with stakeholders and peers. New tools can be added at any time as appropriate.

The toolkit provides flexibility in how a problem is solved, leading to a more open system.

Note: here “tool” does not refer to a software tool or service, often also referred to as tools or tooling. The mechanisms within the Delivery System toolkit may leverage software and describe how it is used.

## Minimum Viable Guardrails

Minimum Viable Guardrails (or MVG's) is a term used to describe the foundational controls of the AMPFlow system. It's core functions is to provide a foundational framework that balances standardisation, adaptability and autonomy.

The purpose of MVG's is to promote lean practices by enabling delivery teams to start with just the minimum
