## Guiding Principles

### Continuous Improvement, Experimentation & Learning

We know we will never know less than we do right now, but that learning requires effort and focus.

We strive for greatness but understand the value of iterative and incremental improvement. 

We learn from our failures and encourage experimentation. 

We challenge ideas and never take a solution on merit. 

We ask difficult questions and respect all opinions. We accept honest and constructive feedback and give it to others.  

### Continuous Deployment

We break value down into the smallest deployable increments, and deploy these constantly.

We ensure that we keep manual involvement in the release process as minimal as possible, and aim to achieve fully automated deployments, so that we can deploy value more often and without friction.

### Continuous Collaboration and Communication

We communicate with each other continually and understand that this is central to the core principles of DevOps and our overall [mission](#our-mission) success.

We recognise that, as a remote and distributed team, continuous collaboration and communication requires more effort than co-located teams. 

We make a noise when blocked, and do not wait to seek support or share progress. 

We don’t wait for updates to come when we have questions. 

We work together to solve problems and share knowledge as we go to prevent dependencies and silos.

### Continuous Testing / Continuous Quality

We always try to understand how we will test that something is working before we create solutions. 

We are all responsible for quality; Testing and quality assurance is performed be everyone; Test Engineers are continuously consulted. 

Our testing starts at the beginning: during discovery, and continues during design, build and release stages. 

We use Test Driven Development, and test automation for unit, integration, UI and end-to-end test, but we also validate with exploratory and manual testing too.

### Continuous Planning

We plan, and re-plan our short, medium, and long-term objectives.

We are responsible for consulting with stakeholders and informing them of the progress on the objectives. 

We are all responsible for delivering our objectives. We work autonomously and are empowered to find the most effective ways of delivering the best solutions.  

### Continuous Autonomy

Each team member is empowered to perform their work without **interference**. 

We aim to provide clarity on expected standards, and we expect teams and individuals to work autonomously within these guidelines.

Beyond the standard expectations specific to each role, each team member is individually accountable for:

- Adhering to our practice values
- Managing their own time and workload in close collaboration with their team  
- Proactively keeping themselves engaged – there is always somewhere you can be helpful, don’t wait to be asked
- Understanding what is required of them
