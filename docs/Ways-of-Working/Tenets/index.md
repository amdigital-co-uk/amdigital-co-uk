title: Tenets
---

**Principals** are quantitative can be controlled, whereas **ideals** are qualitative and can be influenced.

### Working with Tenets

We must hold each other to account for adhering to these tenets, using them as foundations for positive and constructive feedback. 

We must retrospectively evaluate our success by reflecting on our adherence to these tenets.

We must refine our ways of working such that we enhance our ability to adhere to these tenets.

=== "Our Principles"


    <div class="grid cards max" markdown>

    -   __Continuous Improvement__
    
        ---
    
        We are always experimenting and learning and we aim for Continuous Discovery.

        We know we will never know less than we do right now, and learning requires effort and focus.

        We strive for greatness but understand the value of iterative and incremental improvement. 

        We learn from our failures and encourage experimentation. 

        We challenge ideas and never take a solution on merit. 

        We ask difficult questions and respect all opinions. 
        
        We accept honest and constructive feedback and give it to others.  
        
    -   __Continuous Collaboration__
    
        ---

        We communicate with each other continually and understand that this is central to the core principles of DevOps and our overall [mission](#our-mission) success.

        We recognise that, as a remote and distributed team, continuous collaboration and communication requires more effort than co-located teams. 

        We make a noise when blocked, and do not wait to seek support or share progress. 

        We don’t wait for updates to come when we have questions. 

        We work together to solve problems and share knowledge as we go to prevent dependencies and silos.

    -   __Continuous Deployment__
    
        ---

        We break value down into the smallest deployable increments, and deploy these constantly.

        We ensure that we keep manual involvement in the release process as minimal as possible, and aim to achieve fully automated deployments, so that we can deploy value more often and without friction.

    -   __Continuous Quality__
    
        ---

        We produce hypothesis and design solutions and evaluate outcomes and outputs. 

        We understand that quality means valuable as well as functional. Secure and sustainable, reliable and scalable.

        We consider what success means and how we will measure it at the start and throughout the problem lifecycle.

    -   __Continuous Planning__
    
        ---

        We plan, and re-plan our short, medium, and long-term objectives.

        We are responsible for consulting with stakeholders and informing them of the progress on the objectives. 

        We are all responsible for delivering our objectives. We work autonomously and are empowered to find the most effective ways of delivering the best solutions. 

    -   __Continuous Autonomy__
    
        ---
    
        Each team member is empowered to perform their work **without interference**. 

        We aim to provide **clarity** on expected standards, and we expect teams and individuals to work autonomously within these guidelines.

        We are individually **accountable** for:

        - Adhering to our practice principles and tenets
        - Managing their own time and workload in close collaboration with their team  
        - Proactively keeping themselves engaged – there is always somewhere you can be helpful, don’t wait to be asked
        - Working within the governance controls, understanding what is required of them, and finding a way forward
