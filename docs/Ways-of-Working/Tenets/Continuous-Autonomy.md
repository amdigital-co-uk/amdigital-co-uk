## Autonomy Principles

1. **Make suggestions** - If you think there’s a better way of doing things, don’t keep it to yourself.  An autonomous environment requires us all to make suggestions on how we can improve.  Reflect on past suggestions and outcomes to refine your approach and enhance future suggestions.
1. **Experiment** - Don’t be afraid to trial new things.  Treat each experiment as an opportunity for iterative learning and improvement.  Embrace both successes and failures as valuable sources of insight and knowledge.
1. **Set your own direction** - Take ownership of your journey by setting your own direction while aligning it with overarching goals and values.  Embrace autonomy in decision-making, but ensure that your chosen path is purposeful and meaningful.
1. **Anticipate and act** - Proactively identify challenges, opportunities and needs before they arise.  Take initiative by seeking out ways to add value or create positive change.  Don't wait for instructions or circumstances to dictate your actions.
1. **Don’t be afraid to challenge** - Question everything and question again!  Have courage to challenge assumptions and norms.  Innovation and progress often emerges from questioning the status quo.  Approach challenges with curiosity and a commitment to finding better solutions.
1. **Keep yourself informed** - Understand the boundaries that you work within.  You are accountable for adhering to our expected standards and governance controls.  Staying informed empowers you to make better decisions and contribute meaningfully.
