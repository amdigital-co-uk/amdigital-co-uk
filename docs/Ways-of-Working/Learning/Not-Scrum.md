# Introduction 
Currently we use many of the facets of the Scrum Framework to enable iterative and incremental delivery. Having a basic understanding of the fundamentals of Scrum may be helpful to understand our approach.

Scrum is almost the defacto agile delivery approach used by organisations around the world. You can learn about Scrum in much mor detail in the [Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html). 

However, Scrum has it's limitations and drawbacks, and being aware of these is also important. 

You should also have a solid understanding of Agile and DevOps theory and the value they can bring, this will be highly advantageous for the success of your team and the department as a whole.

> Scrum is not Agile, and Agile is not Scrum. They are distinct. 

> Scrum outlines an approach to working in an Agile way, but being Agile requires an Agile mindset, which requires an understanding of its core principles and value proposition.

# Sprint Model
The sprint includes a series of events that occur at the same time each day/sprint.

Besides the key sprint events, there are other events that may occur periodically:
- to support the design & definition of future work - currently as Backlog Refinement (although this will be reviewed as the new [3 Amigos](/Platform-Development-Playbook/Backlog-Management/3-Amigos-&-Readying-Backlog-Items) practice is implemented)
- to plan the runway of work for near future sprints - [Runway planning](/Delivery-Practices/Build-and-Release/Sprint-Cycle//Runway-Planning)

Guidance and details on these events can be found in subpages.

# Product Delivery Teams
These are small, cross functional, self organised "Scrum teams" that design, define, build, test, and release product increments that bring value to the business. These are described as _product backlog items_.

Each team will consist of software engineers, test engineers, and a product manager.

Product Delivery Teams (short hand: "delivery teams") will engage in both "Sprint work"- i.e. building, testing, and releasing product increments - and also preparation work - i.e. the design and definition (aka refinement) of future sprint work. 

## Product Delivery Team Responsibilities
Each of these teams has specific responsibilities that align with [our mission](#our-mission):
	
1. Sprint Success		
    - Determining which of the sprint Candidates can be achieved during the sprint, given the available resources and work that needs to be done (considering the Definition of Done), and communicating this to the Enablement Team
    - Planning how this work will be done, including determining what work needs to be done and devising a strategy for completing it
    - Identify blockers and risks that may prevent sprint success, and promptly communicating them to the Enablement Team
    - Executing the planned work to the [quality standards outlined in the Playbook](/Delivery-Practices/Build-and-Release/Engineering/Quality-Standards)
    - Updating the plan as required, and communicating updates to the Enablement Team
    - Planning and performing releases, and collaborating with the enablement team and other product delivery teams to minimise risk
    - Measuring and reporting on the sprint progress
1. Continued improvement of sprint effectiveness
    - Reflecting upon and reporting on team effectiveness
    - Identifying and implementing initiatives that help improve our overall effectiveness
    - Measuring and reporting on the outcome of such initiatives, positive or negative
	
Delivery teams must communicate the following information to the wider department (i.e. other delivery teams, stakeholders etc)


* Confirmation of sprint backlog (items and sprint priority) and goal following sprint planning
* Details of blockers and risks as and when they arise
* Sprint progress
* Changes to the sprint backlog should the plan needs to be updated
* Overview of sprint outcomes, including stories and total points delivered
