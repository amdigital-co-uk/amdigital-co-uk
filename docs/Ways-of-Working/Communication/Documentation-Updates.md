# Documentation Updates

Documentation at AM is an ongoing project, we're currently focused on improving documentation and making it for everyone to access and discover information to help their understanding of how we work, and the platforms we work on.

!!! Tip 
    Documentation is a living document and is the responsibility of the whole department to improve and update the documentation, don't just leave it for the next person to do.


We have 3 locations where we store documentation as a department:

## Playbook

Here we detail our working practices, for more detail on how to contribute to the playbook see our [Playbook User Guide](../../Playbook-User-Guide/).


## Knowledgebase

Here we detail our practice knowledge of the platform, for more detail on how to contribute to the knowledgebase see our [Knowledgebase User Guide](https://knowledgebase.platformdev.amdigital.co.uk/Knowledgebase-User-Guide/)


## Stack Overflow 

We have a dedicated Platform Development Stack Overflow https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/amplatformdev. 

Stack Overflow is for asking questions that don't have an obvious answer already. These could be error messages on the Platform, which microservice is responsible for a particular feature etc.Before asking someone on Teams, check if this question has already been asked on Stack Overflow - if it hasn't then add the question yourself, it doesn't matter if you don't know the answer yet. 

Once you've been unblocked, it is your responsibility to update the Stackoverflow question with the resolution, **not** the responsibility of the person who unblocked you. 

You may be required to update the knowledgebase with the answer. Sometimes a quick answer on StackOverflow is sufficient. You should use your own judgment here, as a guide consider if the answer is useful without the context of the question, if it is you should be updating the knowledgebase. If you do end up updating the knowledgebase remember to add the link to the article on StackOverflow, and use link anchors if possible.
