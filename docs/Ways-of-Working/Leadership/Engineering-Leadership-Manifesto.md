## Manifesto Statements

Aa a leader in engineering I am;

- **A Servant:** Leading from behind, I'm here to uplift and support. I recognise that commanding others diminishes my leadership strength. I distribute my responsibilities and the responsibilities of my team, so that I am never a single point of failure and to improve resilience. I actively listen, asking more questions than I answer.
- **Mission driven, vision guided:** I am a missionary not a mercenary. I evangelise our [mission](../../index.md#our-mission), vision and values. I look beyond the immediate, with my focus mainly in the medium and long term.
- **Kind:** My interactions are guided by kindness, with absolutely no exceptions.
- **Trusted:** I am open and honest, while acting with integrity and trust. I don't mask or warp the truth, but keep confidentiality as sacred. I have integrity, demonstrating the behaviours I expect of others, and that are expected of me.
- **Accountable:** I take full responsibility for my actions and those of my team, embracing both our successes and learning moments.

I am never going to know less than I know right now, so learning is at the heart of everything. I am;

  - **Bold:** I have strong opinions, loosely held. My views may be distinctive and unpopular. 
  - **Brave:**  The best outcome is being proven wrong, and I actively seek to disprove my views and hypotheses. I am Curious and investigative, brave and willing to explore new ways.
  - **A Mentor:** I see the potential for learning in everyone. Encouraging curiosity, bravery, and professional development is part of my daily to-do list.
  - **A Student:** I am a student of technology and leadership. I'm on a relentless quest for knowledge. And by extension, and among many other things, I and a student of:
      - [The agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org)
      - [The rugged manifesto](https://ruggedsoftware.org/)
      - [Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship](https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/)
      - Lean
      - DevOps

## Duties

Each specific leadership role has specific duties (see the [competency matrix](../../Progression-Framework/engineering-progression-framework.md/#competency-matrix)), and **AMPFlow** carries further duties for certain roles within the problem lifecycle (see [Problem Ownership](../Governance/Problem-Ownership.md)). 

These are generic duties that apply to everyone in any engineering leadership role: 

- Succession planning.
- Seeking Feedback.
- Giving clear and timely feedback to your colleagues around you.
- Report and proactively mitigate problems as they occur.
