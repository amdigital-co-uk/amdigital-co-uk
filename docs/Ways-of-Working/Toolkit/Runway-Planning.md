| **Objective:**        | Map out the deliverables for next several sprints |
| **Organiser/Owner:**  | Product Delivery Teams | 
| **Key stakeholders (required attendees):** | Anyone who wants something delivered in upcoming sprints |
| **Scheduled:**        | Occurs the day before the sprint starts, or earlier. |
| **Frequency:**        | Fortnightly |
| **Team split:**       | 1 per delivery team, offset as enablement team required |

## Overview
Teams must look ahead and map out how the current highest priority backlog items will be delivered over the coming sprints (e.g. next 3-6 sprints). Each product delivery team has their own sprint runway plan.

This will be a dynamic plan, not a fix plan. 

Doing so enables the team to understand the impact of pushing work out of the current sprint - i.e. if we can't do this now, when will we, and what else will be impacted. This supports the team's autonomy, and empowers them to make informed decisions about the best way to complete work.

## Inputs
(e.g. things that have happened before the session)

- Stakeholders - which includes all members of the department - should add items to the backlog, they may speculatively add items into future sprints as well.
- Backlog items will be varying degrees of ready. The more ready it is, the more likely it can be addressed soon!
- The existing sprint runway plan forms the starting point. Each session refines and extends this plan.

## Activities & Outcomes

- If a stakeholder has added something to a sprint, they should use this session to explain why it is important to be done at this time. Together the team can discuss the impact of this item: what needs to be moved to accommodate it, or should this be pushed back/moved forwards.
- The team can add more items into sprints, from the backlog. Anyone is welcome to make suggestions.
- By the end of the session the team should be aligned on what is likely to be in the upcoming sprints - this is their "sprint runway plan". It should cover 3 - 6 sprints.
- The team should have a high level of confidence in the achievability of the very next sprint. Further ahead each sprints will gradually be less certain.



### Relative Sprint Priority
Priority of _backlog items_ should be ranked using standard criteria, such as impact and urgency, and should not be subjective.

_Relative Sprint Priority_ ranks sprint deliverables, i.e. backlog items within the context of a sprint. For example, multiple backlog items may have P2 or P3 priority against them, so they can be ordered in a way that indicated the priority within the context of this specific sprint. Equally, given wider implications (such as blockers or dependencies) it may be preferable or necessary to work on a lower priority item before a higher one.

The product delivery team are responsible for determining their own Relative Sprint Priority. Stakeholders may of course offer their feedback.

## Tips for Success
1. Remember that you are planning to be dynamic, not creating a rigid plan. 
1. Even though you are planning speculatively, you should try to be realistic. Don't overfill upcoming sprints. It will be tempting when stakeholders are all wanting competing work to be complete, but the team understand their competency better than anyone else, so they must communicate what they feel is achievable, and not just what they think stakeholders want to hear.
1. Good estimation will help with good planning. It is important that we measure the success and impact of our estimates.
1. The closer to "Ready" upcoming work is, the easier it will be to plan for it. Make sure you set aside time to get upcoming work [ready](/Platform-Development-Playbook/Backlog-Management/3-Amigos-&-Readying-Backlog-Items).
