## Guide to Running AAR Meetings

At any point throughout the problem lifecycle when an opportunity for learning is identified, the **Delivery Team** facilitate an After Action Review Event and produce an After Action Report.

!!! tip "Plan Ahead"
    Identify during planning when After Action Reviews may be useful (i.e. what are the likely triggers) and communicate this with stakeholders.

    Book your AAR meetings in early to ensure stakeholders can attend and understand expectations

    Plan your meeting carefully in advance.

Teams can use any approach they wish to perform reviews and document outcomes. 

- Review the [toolkit](../../Ways-of-Working/Toolkit/index.md) section for documented approaches, or perform your own research.
- Review the tooling section of the Knowledgebase for current [default document templates](https://knowledgebase.platformdev.amdigital.co.uk/Tools-and-Providers/AMPFlow-Governance/).
