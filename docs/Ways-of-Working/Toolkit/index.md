title: Toolkit

## Purpose

The toolkit outlines the many different mechanisms we may use throughout the problem lifecycle.

> *[**AMPFlow**](../../Ways-of-Working/AMPFlow/index.md) is an an evolving, adaptive, open-closed technology delivery system*

For each problem, different mechanisms will be employed by teams as they see fit, and teams are encouraged to discover new mechanisms and add them to the toolkit.

## Defaults

In some cases, particularly where there are many mechanisms available for to performing certain operations, we may select a "default", in the same way we may select default technologies or patterns. 

Teams would be expected to use the Default approach, unless they have a clear justification for not doing so - for example suitability to their current problem, or while experimenting with new mechanisms.



## Adding to the Toolkit

### Tips

- Mechanisms may be added by team members at at time. 
- Remember to review existing mechanisms. Can you improve, extend, or replace an existing mechanism?
- Use tags to categorise, and to mark a default. Tags help with searching
- Keep documents simple, and use references to reliable external resources rather than repeating what is already published.
- Review and update documents regularly. If you don't think it is right, it may well benefit from improvement.


### Avoid

- Avoid nesting in folders. This is usually done for categorisation, but this often creates unnecessary borders.
- Avoid referencing external resources from highly opinionated or disreputable sites, or where the content is likely to change over time.  
- Don't leave outdated content unresolved. If you think it should be improved, fix it! 

!!! Note
    If there is a default defined, it should be tagged with "Default".
