title: Toolkit
---

## Purpose

The toolkit outlines the many different mechanisms we may use throughout the problem lifecycle, and provides guidance in how to operate with this mechanisms.

> *[**AMPFlow**](../../Ways-of-Working/AMPFlow/index.md) is an an evolving, adaptive, open-closed technology delivery system*

For each problem, different mechanisms will be employed by teams as they see fit, and teams are encouraged to adapt them and discover new mechanisms and add them to the toolkit.

## Defaults

In some cases, particularly where there are many mechanisms available for to performing certain operations or where an approach is preferred or strongly encouraged, we may select a "default", in the same way we may select default technologies or patterns. 

!!! Warning "Guided not Forced"
    We use the principal of guidelines and defaults to enable autonomy. Guidelines and defaults combined is preferred to "best practices", which infer that the best way is already known, and discourages [continuous improvement](../AMPFlow/index.md#tenets){ data-preview }.

Teams would be expected to use the Default approach, unless they have a clear justification for not doing so - for example suitability to their current problem, or while experimenting with new mechanisms.

## Adding to the Toolkit

### Tips

- Mechanisms may be added by team members at at time. 
- Remember to review existing mechanisms. Can you improve, extend, or replace an existing mechanism?
- Use tags to categorise, and to mark a default. Tags help with searching and listings.
- Keep documents simple, and use references to reliable external resources rather than repeating what is already published.
- Review and update documents regularly. If you don't think it is right, it may well benefit from improvement.
- Use **AMPFlow** language, and refer back to AMPFlow components: for example refer to "Problems" and the "Problem Lifecycle" rather than projects, or link back to governance components relevant to a mechanism.


### Avoid

- Avoid nesting in folders. This is usually done for categorisation, but this often creates unnecessary borders.
- Avoid referencing external resources from highly opinionated or disreputable sites, or where the content is likely to change over time.  
- Don't leave outdated content unresolved. If you think it should be improved, fix it! 

!!! Note
    If there is a default defined, it should be tagged with "**Default**".
