## Communities of Practices

Communities of Practice (or CoPs) are derived from the [Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)](https://scaledagileframework.com/communities-of-practice/), which describes them as groups with a common interest in a technical or business issue, and who collaborate to share information, skills, and ideas in order to mutually develop their mastery.

We can develop this idea to cover two areas:

1. core departmental competencies, which covers the primary skill areas within the department, such as product management, software development, testing, design
2. emergent competencies, which covers newly developed or learnt skill or knowledge areas which may later become part of core departmental competencies, such as security testing, behaviour driven development, editorial production workflows, estimation

!!! note 
    Communities of Practice, Centres of Excellence, and Special Interest Groups are various terms for similar principles. Here we are simplifying this into singular term.
