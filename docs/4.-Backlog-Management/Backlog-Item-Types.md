# Overview
A backlog is a list of discrete things we have determined we want to deliver, in order progress out roadmap. A roadmap item therefore has one or more backlog items that must be delivered.

Backlog items deliver different types of things, and therefore take different forms. Understanding and distinguishing the type of backlog item helps us determine [how to prepare it](/Platform-Development-Playbook/Backlog-Management/Definition-of-Ready), estimate it, and plan for it.

Once backlog items are ready, they can be [prioritised within the Product Backlog](#Backlog-Prioritisation) so that they can be selected as [candidates for upcoming sprints](#Sprint-Candidates)

| Type of Deliverable | Purpose | Process |
|--|--|--|
| **Features** and **Changes**| Deliver [Product Roadmap]() items | [Defining Features and Changes](/Platform-Development-Playbook/Defining-Features-and-Changes) |
| **Technical improvements** | Deliver [Technical Roadmap]() items | [Defining Technical Improvements](/Platform-Development-Playbook/Defining-Technical-Improvements) |
| **Bugs** | [Progressed to 3rd Line Support from 2nd Line Support]() | TBC |
| **Knowledge Acquisition** | Support our ability to define and ready the above types | TBC
