# Who is this for?
Describes the way in which we turn roadmap items into ready backlog items.

This document is indented for anyone engaged in creating ready backlog items.


## Quienes son los 3 Amigos?
The term "3 Amigos" refers to the _perspectives_ that are generally required to effectively define the requirements of a roadmap item, be it product, technical, or support:


| Perspective | Identifier |
| --- |--- |
| Business Perspective | in the form of the "Product Owner", usually performed by a Product Manager for product roadmap items, support manager for support items etc, tech lead for tech items |
| Engineering Perspective | in the form of a "Technical Lead" (usually a software engineer or architect)|
| Quality Assurance Perspective | in the form of a "Test Lead" (usually a test engineer)|

As such each Roadmap item is assigned a Product Owner, a Technical Lead, and a Test Lead. Although there are typical business roles that map to the 3A role (indicated above), each of them _can_ be assigned to any person who can perform the duties effectively. 

The three amigos approach aims to ensure that the _smallest group of people possible_ will collaborate to create a ready backlog item. It is of course possible therefore that more than 3 people will be required, for example, a Design lead where there are UI components to deliver.

The three Amigos will work with other stakeholders from across the business as they go through Definition phase. For example, the Tech Lead should consult with other engineers and the Architect.

### Responsibilities

The Three Amigos are collectively responsible for:
- creating ready backlog items that describe an effective solution to the problem
- ensuring that ready backlog items are produced "in time", and communicating with the Head of Product about their progress and blockers.
- ensuring that they engage with the right stakeholders
- recording their activities and decisions
- planning and executing the definition work
- supporting the build and release phase by resolving queries and updating requirements

`// TODO:  Set out the specific responsibilities of each of the 3A roles.
