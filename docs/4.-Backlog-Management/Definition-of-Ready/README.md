# What's a Definition of Ready?
A ready backlog item is one that can be immediately actioned (or _worked on_) by a delivery team. That means it must have enough information in it in order for it to be delivered by the team fast and effectively. 

The Definition of Ready (DOR), therefore, outlines the characteristics and information - described as _artefacts_ - that a delivery team would need in order to action an backlog item.

However, caution must be taken to ensure that the DOR does not become a set of linear gates that effectively prevent us working in an agile way. We must balance the benefits of having a clear and aligned understanding of our objective that enables with being able to adapt quickly.

Each backlog item type will have it's own DOR, and corressponding artefacts. 

2 Key DORs are:

1. [Features and Changes](Defining-Features-and-Changes/)
1. [Technical Improvements](Defining-Technical-Improvements/)

Information regarding producing each artefact type can be found within the [3 Amigos & Readying Backlog Items](/4.-Backlog-Management/3-Amigos-%26-Readying-Backlog-Items/) section.

> Note: The Definition of Ready should be considered a guide rather than a set of hard rules. The artefacts actually needed will vary depending on the nature of the backlog item. It is up to the [3 Amigos team](/4.-Backlog-Management/3-Amigos-%26-Readying-Backlog-Items/) to determine what readiness means for each backlog item as they go through the definition processes.
