# Who is this for?
This playbook outlines the continually evolving frameworks, processes, and practices that are used by the Platform Development Division to enable us to reliably deliver against [our collective mission](/1.-Welcome/Mission).

All members of the Platform Development Division - Product Management, Software Engineering, Test Engineering, Platform Support.

# Ownership and Responsibility
Every member of the division is responsible for ensuring that this playbook is up to date and accurate.

**When you create, review, or modify a document, you are responsible for ensuring that it is well written and has been peer reviewed, and that review date is set.**

You must always provide a _page header_, using the following YAML heading set at the very top of each document in the playbook.

# Structure
`// TODO: : What are the structures that should be used (subpages, headings, TOCs, tags etc)

# Reviewing
Documents should be peer reviewed after initial publication, and following significant revisions. They should also be subject to periodic reviews to ensure they are up to date, relevant, and accurate.

## Peer Reviewing
The primary purpose of a review is to ensure that the documentation is as useful as it can be. 

- The peer reviewer should carefully read and understand the content of the document. Consider the audience of the document and its purpose. 
- Ensure the page header is populated and accurate, and that a review date has been provided.
- Check for typos and errors if possible, although this is not the primary purpose of review. 
- Provide constructive feedback to the author for revision.

## Periodic Reviews
On or around the review date, the document should be checked for validity. 

The purpose of a review is to ensure that the document is still as useful as it can be, or deleted if it is no longer required.

Updates may happen at any time, but it is possible that changes to frameworks, processes, and practices have happened and not been documented. 

- After a review, ensure that the Next Review Date in the page header is updated, regardless of whether any changes have been made.
- If a major revision is performed, add the name of the revising author(s) to the page header, and ensure that the revision is peer reviewed.
