# General Guidelines for Documentation

## Including the correct information and putting it in the right place
- Firstly, review the section on Documentation Types, and follow those guidelines!
- Generally, some documentation is better than no documentation. It doesn't need to be perfect or complete straight away!
- Always include information about when the document was first written AND last reviewed.

## Knowing the correct audience 
- Include, at the start, who the target audience is, and write documentation that will be understood by that audience. 
- Consider the value that this audience will gain from it, and summarise this as the purpose of the document.
- If there is a need for technical and non-technical readers, consider breaking it up.

## How to keep it up to date
- Documentation should be reviewed periodically as most types of documentation have a fairly short lifespan.
- It is important that we know when we will next review each document, as such this should be determined when a document is published and when it is reviewed or updated.
- Obviously this does not apply to all types of document - such as code and commit comments.
- Repository readmes should always be reviewed and updated when related code is changed

## Ownership
- The creator / reviewer is responsible for determining the next review date

# Documentation Types
We can perceive documentation as having different _"levels"_. From high level documentation covering ways of working with the widest audience, to lowest level documentation covering the function of modules or even lines of code.
Within each level there are a number of types of documentation. Specific guidelines for each of these levels and their types are detailed in the subpages of this section of the wiki.

| **Level** | **Types** | **Locations** |
|--|--|--|
| **Department & Team Level**  | Process and practice guidance, standards, onboarding | [The Platform Development Playbook](/) |
| **Platform Level** | Architecture, infrastructure, patterns, developer guides |  Knowledge Base, Non-functional requirements |  
| **Business Value & Functional level** | Functional requirements, Strategy, Roadmap items |  Functional guides, Roadmaps, Backlog Items & Feature Files |  
| **Solution/Repository Level** | Solution overview, Solution-specific architecture & coding patterns, Build & run guides, Dependencies and known issues, Change & release logs  | ReadMe files, Code commit messages, Release plans, Knowledge Base 
| **Interface Level** | UI user guides, API developer guides  | User guides, Endpoint comments/Swagger(etc.) API documentation |  
| **Code Level** | Code comments | Classes and methods |
