# Who is this for?
This is the place to start when you join Platform Development at AM. It is designed for new starters, regardless of their role.

It will point you to key areas of the playbook, to provide a quick overview of the department and how we work.

Much of this should be covered during your induction. The playbook is your companion from induction to mastery.
