## First Way: Understanding and optimising flow

Understanding and optimising *flow* means improving the rate at which we deliver work: i.e. **maximising our net effectiveness**.

When we talk about "flow" or "flow of work", we mean entire system or "whole". Often software delivery teams only evaluate their effectiveness within one part of the system, for example the bit when engineers write and test code. In fact the system is much larger and than this. Looking at just one part of the whole may allow us to make that part more efficient, and yet the whole system could become less effective.

Evaluating a whole system is often known as systems thinking. When we look at an entire system we can see the interactions between system components, and where there are bottlenecks, also known as **constraints**. This helps us improve our system.

For example: understanding system interactions helps clarify the impact of quality on subsequent parts of the system, and understanding constraints helps us discover which parts of the system are the slowest and make improvements.

Technology teams are often expected to just "get it done" and discouraged from understanding the dynamics of the system in which they play a critical role. This approach impacts autonomy and reduces the ability of rapid decision making and learning.

## Value Stream Mapping

One way of evaluating a whole system is **Value Stream Mapping**. The value stream refers to the flow that produces business value from end to end. Each business will have multiple value streams.

Value stream maps can be created in many different ways.

### Value Stream Map Examples

### Our Value Stream Map

We maintain our own value stream map and have aligned this with our [Delivery Framework](../3.-Delivery-Framework/). Our delivery framework outlines the high level phases of our value stream and the basic purpose of each phase. As it is only a high level, it shouldn't need to change often.

Our [Delivery Practices](../4.-Delivery-Practices/) documentation outlines the dynamics within each of these phases in greater detail. These dynamics will change more often and we evolve.
