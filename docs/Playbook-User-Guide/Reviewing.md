## Reviewing

Documents should be peer reviewed after initial publication, and following significant revisions. They should also be subject to periodic reviews to ensure they are up to date, relevant, and accurate.

### Peer Reviewing

The primary purpose of a review is to ensure that the documentation is as useful as it can be. 

- The peer reviewer should carefully read and understand the content of the document. Consider the audience of the document and its purpose. 
- Ensure the page header is populated and accurate, and that a review date has been provided.
- Check for typos and errors if possible, although this is not the primary purpose of review. Use a spell checker.
- Provide constructive feedback to the author for revision.

### Periodic Reviews

On or around the review date, the document should be checked for validity. 

The purpose of a review is to ensure that the document is still as useful as it can be, or deleted if it is no longer required.

Updates may happen at any time, but it is possible that changes to frameworks, processes, and practices have happened and not been documented. 

- After a review, ensure that the Next Review Date in the page header is updated, regardless of whether any changes have been made.
- If a major revision is performed, add the name of the revising author(s) to the page header, and ensure that the revision is peer reviewed.
