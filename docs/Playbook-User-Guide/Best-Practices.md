## General Guidelines for Documentation

### Including the correct information and putting it in the right place

- There may be specific guidelines for specific types of documentation. Use them!
- Generally, some documentation is better than no documentation. It doesn't need to be perfect or complete straight away!
- Always include information about when the document was first written AND last reviewed.

### Knowing the correct audience

- Be sure to consider the primary audience, but try to accommodate as wide an audience as possible.
- Consider the value that this audience will gain from it. It is good practice to summarise the value of the document at the start.
- If there is a need for technical and non-technical readers, consider breaking it up: start high level and gradually go deeper.

### How to keep it up to date

- Documentation should be reviewed periodically as most types of documentation have a fairly short lifespan.
- It is important that we know when we will next review each document, as such this should be determined when a document is published and when it is reviewed or updated.
- Obviously this does not apply to all types of document - such as code and commit comments.
- Repository readmes should always be reviewed and updated when related code is changed

## Ownership

The creator / reviewer is responsible for determining the next review date

Everyone is responsible for ensuring documentation remains up to date.

## Reviewing

Almost any type of documentation should be reviewed by others before it is published.

As a good rule of thumb use 2 reviewers with an opposing understanding of the topic (i.e. an expert and a novice).

When reviewing:

- take time to read the document carefully
- be prepared to give clear and constructuive feedback


Different types of documentation use different tools and mechanisms for feedback.
